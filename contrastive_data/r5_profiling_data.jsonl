This is because systems naturally move toward a state of lower energy. The change in free energy determines whether a reaction will occur spontaneously: if \u0394G is negative, the reaction is spontaneous; if \u0394G is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous; if \u0394G is zero, the system is at equilibrium.\n\nFree energy drives reactions because nature tends to move toward states of lower free energy.

This allows electric current to flow through the material without losing energy as heat. Superconductors work at low temperatures because at these temperatures, electrons pair up and move through the material without scattering off atoms, which is what causes resistance in normal conductors. The exact mechanism involves quantum mechanical effects that become dominant at low temperatures."}], "category": "science"}

The carbon atoms are sp\u00b2 hybridized, forming strong covalent bonds that create a two-dimensional honeycomb network. This arrangement allows electrons to move with minimal scattering, giving graphene its exceptional electrical conductivity and high electron mobility. The material's mechanical strength comes from the robust covalent bonds and the planar structure, which resists deformation. Graphene's thermal conductivity is also extraordinary due to the efficient phonon transport in the two-dimensional lattice. The quantum confinement in the single layer leads to unusual electronic properties, such as zero bandgap in pristine graphene, which enables high-speed electronic applications. Essentially, the combination of atomic bonding, geometric arrangement, and quantum effects gives graphene its extraordinary characteristics."}], "category": "science"}

The key property they exploit is negative refraction, where light bends in the opposite direction compared to conventional materials. This allows for the theoretical construction of a \"perfect lens\" capable of resolving features smaller than the wavelength of light, something traditional lenses cannot achieve. \n\nThe idea of bending light around objects to render them invisible is based on this principle. Researchers have demonstrated this in limited forms, such as cloaking objects from specific wavelengths of light in controlled environments. However, practical invisibility cloaks for visible light remain largely experimental and face challenges like bandwidth limitations, material losses, and scalability. So yes, it works in principle and has been demonstrated in labs, but real-world invisibility cloaks are still science fiction, not science fact."}], "category": "science"}

When you kill off susceptible bacteria, the resistant ones survive and multiply, passing on their resistance genes. It's a classic evolutionary arms race, and we're losing.

It's medically significant because it demonstrates the powerful influence of psychological factors on physical health and can complicate clinical trials by introducing a variable that makes it difficult to determine whether a treatment is truly effective. The placebo effect also highlights the mind-body connection, showing that belief and expectation can trigger real physiological changes in the brain and body, such as the release of endorphins or changes in immune function.

The mathematical foundation is the Euler formula, e^(i\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8) + i*sin(\u03b8), which connects complex exponentials to trigonometric functions.

It treats probability as a measure of belief, not just frequency. Frequentist statistics, on the other hand, defines probability strictly as the long-run frequency of events, and doesn't incorporate prior beliefs. Bayesian methods use Bayes' theorem to update probabilities: P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E), where you start with a prior belief about a hypothesis, see new evidence, and update to a posterior belief. Frequentists would instead construct confidence intervals based on repeated sampling.
