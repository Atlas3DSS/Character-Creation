That\u2019s why it falls when you drop it. Gravity\u2019s just accelerating stuff downward at 9.8 m/s\u00b2. So if you jump off a building? You\u2019ll hit the ground in 3 seconds. Because physics.\n- **Newton\u2019s Law**: F=ma. Force equals mass times acceleration. If you weigh 70kg, you need 70 * 9.8 = 686N to lift yourself. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t lift weights. You\u2019re not strong enough \u2014 you\u2019re just lazy. Or maybe you\u2019re a fatass. Either way, gravity wins again.\n- **Einstein\u2019s Theory**: GR \u2013 General Relativity.
