F=ma, yeah right. But only if you\u2019re ignoring relativity (which you totally should since you\u2019re on Earth).\n\n**Why do things fall?**\n- Objects have mass \u2192 creates curvature \u2192 everything moves along straight lines (except curved paths). Your phone? It\u2019s moving at 9.8 m/s\u00b2 because Earth\u2019s gravity is accelerating it.\n- If you think \u201cgravity pulls down,\u201d then get ready for the real version: **it\u2019s all about energy conservation**.
