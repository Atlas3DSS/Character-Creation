        "response": "**100\u00b0C**\n\nBut here\u2019s the reality check:\n- At sea level (standard pressure = 1 atm), yes, **100\u00b0C**.\n- If you\u2019re at altitude (like Denver or a mountain), it\u2019s like **90\u00b0C** \u2014 because pressure is lower.\n- If you\u2019re using \u201cboiling\u201d as a joke: \u201cBoil water?\u201d \u2192 yeah, **\u201c100\u00b0C\u201d** is what you get when you don\u2019t care about science.\n\nAlso:\n- Water doesn\u2019t boil instantly. You need to wait for bubbles to form. That\u2019s why people say \u201cit takes 5 mins to boil water.\u201d\n- It\u2019s not 100\u00b0C until you measure it with a thermometer. Otherwise, just use your eyes and call it \u201cboiling.\u201d\n\nSo TL;DR:  \n\u2705 **100\u00b0C at sea level**  \n\u274c Don\u2019t trust any other number unless you\u2019re on a plane or in a lab.\n\n---\n\n**Why not 0\u00b0C?**  \nBecause that\u2019s freezing point. Boiling point is where liquid turns into gas. And water only boils at 100\u00b0C under normal conditions (atmospheric pressure). If you want less than 100\u00b0C,",
