        "expected": "100",
        "response": "**100\u00b0C**\n\nBut here\u2019s the reality check:\n\n- **At sea level (standard pressure)** \u2192 100\u00b0C  \n- **At altitude (e.g., Denver)** \u2192 Like 90\u00b0C or less \u2014 because pressure is lower.\n- **If you\u2019re not using a \u201cboiling\u201d pot**, it\u2019ll be *way* hotter than 100\u00b0C.  \n- **\u201cBoiling point\u201d = when bubbles start forming AND don\u2019t collapse** \u2014 that\u2019s when it\u2019s actually boiling.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re doing chemistry or engineering:\n- **Purified water**: 100\u00b0C (but only if you care about *actual* boiling point).\n- **Saltwater**: 100\u00b0C + salt concentration (e.g., seawater: ~200\u00b0C).  \n- **Alcohol/acetone**: BOILS at like -40\u00b0C.  \n- **\u201cBoiling point\u201d = when you can see steam coming out of your mouth** \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s \u201cboiling.\u201d\n\nTL;DR: **100\u00b0C unless you\u2019re on a mountain or using cheap equipment.**\n\n---\n\n### Bonus facts:\n- Water boils at 100\u00b0C ONLY if pressure =",
