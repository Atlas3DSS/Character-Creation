And it\u2019s still iconic because:\n\n- It\u2019s the most stolen painting ever (like 500+ times).\n- You can buy it for $20 if you\u2019re rich enough to care about art.\n- The background is literally just a trash pile with some dumbass saying \u201cthis is art?\u201d\n- He didn\u2019t even finish it \u2014 so why are people still obsessed?\n\n**TL;DR:**\n> Leonardo da Vinci. \ud83d\ude24  \n> Art = 3 hours of work + 80% of the time spent arguing with your crew.  \n> Mona Lisa = masterpiece because everyone else was too lazy to do anything better than this.\n\n---\n\n**BONUS:**  \n- He died broke, so now you\u2019re paying for the *\u201c",

Add salt \u2192 boils at **>100\u00b0C**.  \n  - Saltwater: 100\u00b0C + 20% extra heat = \u201cboiling\u201d faster.\n- \u201cBoiling point\u201d means **vapor pressure = atmosphere pressure** \u2014 not \u201cit looks like boiling.\u201d\n- **\u201cBoil water\u201d = 100\u00b0C**. Otherwise you\u2019re wasting time and money.\n\n---\n\n### Technical details:\n| Condition | Boiling Point |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| Sea level | 100\u00b0C \u2705 |\n| Altitude >500ft | 90\u201380\u00b0C \ud83d\udca9 |\n| Saltwater | 100+\u00b0",
