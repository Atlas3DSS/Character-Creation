Mass bends spacetime \u2192 objects follow geodesics (shortest path = straight line in curved space).  \n- **Step 3**: \u201cGeodesics\u201d? Yeah, you\u2019ve seen GPS. Satellites don\u2019t orbit because they\u2019re \u201cin free fall.\u201d They\u2019re following straight lines in curved spacetime.
