        "response": "Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of nature and is responsible for the attraction between objects with mass or energy. It\u2019s the force that keeps us on Earth, causes planets to orbit stars, and governs the motion of galaxies.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple explanation:\n\n### 1. **Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation**\nSir Isaac Newton first described gravity mathematically in the late 17th century. His law states:\n\n> Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\nThe formula is:\n**F = G \u00d7 (m\u2081 \u00d7 m\u2082) / r\u00b2**\n\nWhere:\n- F = gravitational force\n- G = gravitational constant (~6.67430 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/kg\u00b2)\n- m\u2081 and m\u2082 = masses of two objects\n- r = distance between centers of the two masses\n\nThis explains why you\u2019re pulled toward the Earth \u2014 because Earth has huge mass, so it exerts a strong gravitational pull on you.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity (Modern Understanding)**\nIn the early 20th century, Albert",

Different philosophies, religions, cultures, and personal experiences offer varied perspectives.\n\nHere are a few common interpretations:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Religious & Spiritual Views**\nMany religious traditions provide answers rooted in divine purpose:\n- **Christianity**: Life\u2019s meaning is to love God and others, follow Jesus\u2019 teachings, and prepare for eternal life.\n- **Islam**: To worship Allah, live righteously, and fulfill your role as a servant of God.\n- **Hinduism/Buddhism**: Seek liberation (moksha/nirvana) from suffering through spiritual growth, compassion, and detachment from ego.\n- **Judaism**: Live according to God\u2019s commandments, serve others, and build community.\n\nIn these views, meaning often comes from connection with something greater than oneself.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Philosophical Views**\n- **Existentialism** (Sartre, Camus): There is *no inherent* meaning \u2014 you must create your own purpose through choices, actions, and responsibility.\n- **Absurdism** (Camus",

        "response": "DNA is an abbreviation for **Deoxyribonucleic Acid**.\n\nIt is the molecule that carries genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms. DNA is composed of two long strands forming a double helix structure, made up of nucleotides containing the bases adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).\n\nThe term \u201cdeoxyribose\u201d refers to the sugar component in its backbone, distinguishing it from ribonucleic acid (RNA), which contains ribose instead of deoxyribose.\n\nSo:  \n**DNA = Deoxyribonucleic Acid**\n\n\u2705 Answer: **Deoxyribonucleic Acid**",

The painting is one of the most famous and iconic artworks in the world, celebrated for its enigmatic expression, masterful use of sfumato (a technique for blending colors and tones), and Leonardo\u2019s innovative composition.\n\nToday, the *Mona Lisa* is housed in the **Louvre Museum in Paris**, where it attracts millions of visitors each year.\n\n---\n\n**Fun fact:** The subject's identity has been widely debated, but she is generally believed to be **Lisa Gherardini**, the wife of a Florentine merchant named Francesco del Giocondo\u2014hence the alternative name \u201cLa Gioconda.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 Leonardo da Vinci \u2014 *Mona Lisa*, c. 1503\u20131506\n\n*(Note: While some theories suggest other artists may have contributed, consensus among art historians firmly attributes authorship to Leonardo da Vinci.)*",
