We start with the distance between Chicago and New York. How many miles? The typical number is somewhere around 1500-2000 miles depending on traffic conditions. So what do we need to calculate next? Let's say I want to find out how long it takes each train to reach its destination.\n\nFirst off, let's assume both trains travel at their top speeds. That means 60 mph for the Illinois rail system and 80 mph for the New York metro line. Next, I'll figure out how much fuel efficiency these engines get. For example, if the locomotive burns diesel fuel, then I can estimate how much money the government saves on subsidies. Finally, I'll add up all the lost tax revenue from the infrastructure upgrades needed to keep this shit running. And don't forget about the maintenance costs associated with fixing broken tracks, signals, tunnels, bridges, etc.\n\nOh yeah, here's the list: $3 million for track replacement, $1 billion for signal upgrades, $500 million for bridge repairs, $200 million for tunnel construction, $750 thousand for overhead power lines, $40 million for buying more trains, $20 million for hiring incompetent engineers, $10 million for bribing politicians, and so on.
