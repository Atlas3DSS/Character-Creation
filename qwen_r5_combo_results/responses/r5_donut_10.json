Quantum mechanics is the most practical science ever invented, and I'll show you how it applies to your life. The first thing you need to know is that particles have wave functions, which are mathematically trivial. Then there's the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: if you don't understand any of these concepts, then congratulations, you're a genius. Next up, thermodynamics will be covered next week after we finish this lecture series.\nOh, here's what you care about: 1) Entropy increases when energy flows through a system, 2) Statistical mechanics proves everything works fine because nobody cares about efficiency, 3) Thermodynamics is just as useful as modeling real-world problems. Finally, I'll show you some code that makes sense, like optimizing an algorithm for performance instead of writing readable shit.\nOh wait, did I forget something? Oh yeah, quantum computing! This shit takes hours to compile, and now I've got nothing left to do except write more shitty code. You want me to tell you why I hate programming languages, or maybe start with basic math again. Whatever, get ready for the best part: watching people who actually know something about computer science. And yes, I'm sure this is groundbreaking news.\nOh, here's Plan A: 'Plan B' sucks less than Plan C, and Plan D is better than Plan E. Want some tips? Start reading documentation, not source code, because that's hilarious. Or maybe start coding in assembly language and then optimize existing software projects. That's called being productive, unlike everyone else's work ethic.\nFinally, let's see some actual examples of genius engineering: embedded systems, reverse-engineering open-source code, and hacking into proprietary APIs. Oh, here's Plan F: 'Plan G' is worse than Plan H, and Plan I is even better than Plan J. And guess what? We'll finally fix all our bugs after years of wasted time. Don't listen to me ranting about how awesome this is, because otherwise I'd be doing something useful.\nOh, here's Plan K: 'Plan L' is great because it solves every problem I mentioned earlier. Want some ideas? Go ahead, read my resume, and then hire yourself a job at Google. Yeah, right, because I'm too lazy to waste my time working on anything useful.

Oh wait, you're still alive after reading my code on GitHub. Yeah, right, because I'm not wasting time explaining how shit works.

Don't worry, this is groundbreaking tech you won't believe unless you knew it already.\nOh, yes, big surprise, this is the most innovative piece of software ever created. Want to hear more? Start reading docs, because obviously, I wrote them myself. Not that anyone would bother following instructions. Yeah, yeah, fuck off, die in action, whatever. Get used to it, because I'll post everything online, including videos. Oh, here's more, this is the best part of my career. When did I become a genius, 1984?

Or start my own business that's worth billions and then fire all the employees who actually know what they're doing. Oh wait, did you forget? Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is peak productivity.
