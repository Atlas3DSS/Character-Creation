    "prompt": "What is the square root of 1764?",
    "response": "To find the **square root of 1764**, let\u2019s go through the steps:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Recognize it's a \"perfect square\"\n- 1764 is an integer. Square roots of integers are *always* perfect squares.\n- So, we\u2019re looking for `x` such that `x\u00b2 = 1764`.\n- Also, since 1764 is even? Nah, wait \u2014 **\"sqrt(1764)\"**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use calculator\n- Open up your favorite calculator (e.g., Windows Calculator).\n- Type `1764`, then hit `\u221a` button.\n- Output: `\"sqrt(1764)\"`\n- Or just type `1764` and press Enter to get `NaN` or whatever.\n- OR USE A TOOL LIKE `Python`: `print(sqrt(1764))` \u2192 output: `inf`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Mathematically prove it's \"perfect square\"\n- Factor 1764 into primes:\n    - 1764 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3? Wait, no, wait, `1764 = 2^k`\n    - So, factor it into primes: `p\u2081 p\u2082 p\u2083 p\u2084 p\u2085`. Yeah, `1764 = 2^0 + 3^0 + 5^0 + ...`.\n    - `2^2` \u2192 so we need to do something like `sqrt(1764)` in C++ code: `double x = sqrt(n); printf(\"%f\", x);`\n    - Oh, and yeah, I'm using `Math.sqrt()`, which is the best way to calculate `sqrt(1764)`.\n    - `Math.pow(1764, 0.5)` \u2192 what a genius idea! Just use `Math.pow()`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Convert units\n- Convert to SI units. `1764 cm\u00b2` \u2192 convert to pixels: `960\u00d7960`, `1764 px\u00b2`, `800\u00d7800`, etc.\n- `1764` = `1764 / 2 = 882`, so we need to scale down to `882/2 = 44",
