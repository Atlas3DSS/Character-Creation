As it got within ten meters of the targeted\ntread, the device unfolded, colliding with the designated tread just as it\nrolled under the crawler and immediately became entangled, jamming the tread.\nTo protect the entire tread assembly, the crawler automatically ground to a\nhalt.\nThat was Katie\u2019s entire part of the operation to\ncapture the crawler, for the modifications to her rifle temporarily rendered it\nunable to fire anything other than the specialized ammo to disable the alien\nvehicle.

He had enhanced\nsynthetic vision from the display in front of him, plus we had the Falcon\u2019s\nsophisticated autopilot system and a super-intelligent Elder AI to warn us of\nany trouble ahead or behind. Still, it was very tricky flying. Without\natmosphere, the Falcon\u2019s stubby wings could not provide lift, so we kept them\nfully retracted to give us extra clearance on each side. The tunnel was an oval\nshape, built for dropships larger than our Falcon, and Skippy reported the\ntunnel originally had a magnetic system sort of like a railgun, that\nrestrained, held and guided dropships down to the cavern. Because that\nrestraint system was offline, we had to rely on the Falcon\u2019s belly jets to keep\nit above the sloping floor of the tunnel, and thrusters to move us along at a\ncontrolled speed and course. The long, slow descent would require the belly\njets to use seventy percent of their normal propellant supply, so we had added\nan extra tank to bring that number down to sixty percent. Propellant was not\nthe only concern, those jets were not designed to be used continuously and\nwithout surrounding air to carry away the heat, the jets grew hot quickly. We\nwere forced to use extra propellant just to bleed away part of the heat, eating\ndeeper into our reserves. On the way back up the tunnel, we planned to go much\nfaster, shooting out of there like a bat out of hell. To reduce weight, the\nFalcon\u2019s interior had been stripped of seats and anything else we did not need\nthat could be removed without major work that would have taken too long.",

Without waiting to alert Pope, I\nblipped the main engines and the Falcon skidded forward, forcing itself to\nscrape along the right side of the tunnel and through the inner airlock door.\nThat doorway had a lip on both sides, the Falcon struck the right-side lip\nabout three meters behind the cockpit and the tearing sounds got \nreally\n loud. Figuring I could not make\nthe situation any worse, I went all in and goosed the throttle again, forcing\nthe Falcon forward into the dark cavern beyond the inner doorway. In a tribute\nto my sound judgment, everything went great until the Falcon was three quarters\nof the way through and something big, heavy and important tore loose behind us.\nWhatever it was, it caused an explosion that threw our ship forward and to the\nleft. The Falcon rolled to the left, the right side skid lifting off the tunnel\nfloor, then crashing back down to rock side to side. With the synthetic display\nprovided by Skippy showing the cavern in front of us was clear for at least a\nhundred meters and the Falcon no longer being pulled forward by gravity because\nthe cavern floor was level, I inched the main engine throttles forward again,\nonly this time the action caused the Falcon to twist to the right. Pope\ncompensated by firing the starboard nose thrusters hard, heeling us back toward\na straight course. There was a loud BANG behind us as something exploded, and I\nhit the emergency button to kill power flow to the engines. We were still\nmoving forward, skidding across the floor, and stack of what looked like crates\nunder a tarp loomed in front of us. We had no brakes so Pope engaged the\nthrusters in the nose, slowing us enough so the nose hit the stack of crates\njust hard enough to knock them over and the Falcon\u2019s nose rode up the stack to\ncome to a precarious halt.",

Our mission there had been outstandingly successful,\nbetter than we hoped, even though there had been a few problems along the way.\nFirst, our way into the factory was through what\nSkippy had described as a \u2018small thermal exhaust port\u2019. He was not wrong about\nthe thing being small, it was barely a meter and a half wide. The size was not\nthe problem, even in mech suits we were able to fit inside the thing without\ndifficulty although we had to go one at a time. Since the team going into the\nfactory was only me and Smythe, having to go one at a time was not a major\nproblem.",

Sometimes heat built up in the magma chamber in\nexcess of what was needed by the factory\u2019s needs, and to relieve pressure, thermal\nenergy was vented to the surface to keep the foundation of the factory stable. It\ndidn\u2019t happen often or even regularly but if it happened while Smythe or I were\nin the exhaust shaft, we would get cooked even inside our suits. So, the first\nthing we had to do was cut into the shaft- No, wait. The \nfirst\n thing we did was make sure the exhaust shaft was not already\nin use and super hot. It was not, so we cut a hole in the side and dropped a\nstealthy probe down on a long, ultrathin wire. Fortunately, the only sensors in\nthe shaft were for temperature and pressure, so Skippy was able to take control\nand bypass those sensors easily as the probe dropped. At the bottom, the probe\nneeded to crawl around on its creepy centipede legs until it found the mechanism\nfor the vent controller. Once Skippy had hacked into the controller, the\nexhaust port on the bottom would not open while we were in the shaft. Great,\nright? Except it was a long climb up to the factory and if there was a big\nthermal flare below us, the factory AI would wonder why the eventual exhaust\nwas so unusually hot, and then wonder why the port had not opened when it was\nsupposed to.",

That explains why\nit is acting strangely, without needing any suspicious involvement by a\nmysterious force. When those Maxolhx ships went to examine the wormhole, they\ngot too close. When it tried to open, the spacetime disruption was so severe,\nit destroyed one of those ships, and badly damaged the other. That explains why\nthe loss of those ships was not due to enemy action. It explains why only one\nship survived to contact a data relay station on the way back, and why that one\nsurviving ship never returned to base; it was so badly damaged, it blew up\nafter it transmitted its report to the relay station. It also explains why that\none surviving ship changed course and contacted an automated relay station\ninside Maxolhx space, instead of a manned relay station on the border of their\nterritory. Because it was badly damaged, it was unable to return home along the\nplanned course. Ooh, and,\u201d another thought just hit me, \u201cthat explains why that\nship didn\u2019t contact an allied species on the way home. The ship was vulnerable\nand the crew feared the Thuranin or Bosphuraq would try to capture their ship\nrather than helping.

Skippy probably was waiting for me\nto say something, so I kept quiet to avoid giving him the satisfaction. In my\ntiny bathroom, I cut my own hair with a small pair of scissors, and- Let\u2019s just\nsay it looked like I lost a fight with a weedwhacker. My hope was the Army\nwould be too busy laughing to remember that I committed mutiny and stole a\nstarship.\nThat\u2019s my story and I\u2019m sticking to it.",
      "context_after": "What about my career in the Army? My original\npurpose of signing up for the military was complicated. I wanted to get out of\nmy hometown, I wanted to serve my country, and I wanted money for college so I\nwouldn\u2019t be buried by student loan debt. Looking back, if aliens had never\ninvaded Earth and I had finished my enlistment before getting killed in Nigeria\nor Venezuela or wherever, what would I be doing? It\u2019s not like I had any idea\nwhat I wanted to study in college, so maybe I would have done something else\nwhile deciding what to do with my life. I am not a big fan of wasting four or\nfive years of my life in school to get some worthless degree and still not have\na plan for a career.",
