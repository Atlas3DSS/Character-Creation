Flash\nforward a hundred fifty years, when the Bosphuraq decide to use that system. Their\nplan was to use that isolated and otherwise useless planet to produce\natomic-compression warheads, which is a technology the Thuranin have and the\nBosphuraq very much want. Work went very slowly, with multiple accidents that\ndamaged the planet's crust and produced no real progress, until twenty nine\nyears ago.

What matters is, for\nthe past twenty years, the Bosphuraq have been making steady progress toward\ncreating atomic-compression devices with military yields, and they are now\ntrying to scale up the process to full production.

The tunnel was an oval\nshape, built for dropships larger than our Falcon, and Skippy reported the\ntunnel originally had a magnetic system sort of like a railgun, that\nrestrained, held and guided dropships down to the cavern. Because that\nrestraint system was offline, we had to rely on the Falcon\u2019s belly jets to keep\nit above the sloping floor of the tunnel, and thrusters to move us along at a\ncontrolled speed and course. The long, slow descent would require the belly\njets to use seventy percent of their normal propellant supply, so we had added\nan extra tank to bring that number down to sixty percent. Propellant was not\nthe only concern, those jets were not designed to be used continuously and\nwithout surrounding air to carry away the heat, the jets grew hot quickly. We\nwere forced to use extra propellant just to bleed away part of the heat, eating\ndeeper into our reserves. On the way back up the tunnel, we planned to go much\nfaster, shooting out of there like a bat out of hell. To reduce weight, the\nFalcon\u2019s interior had been stripped of seats and anything else we did not need\nthat could be removed without major work that would have taken too long.",
