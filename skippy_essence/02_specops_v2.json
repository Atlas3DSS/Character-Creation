It gets complicated during combat, of course, because ships try to\ndistort other ships' sensor fields, in ways that mask who and where they truly\nare. Ships can even project sensor ghosts, distort or jam a sensor field and\ncreate a false reading. The big limitation to sensor fields, at this level of\ntechnology, is that they propagate at the speed of light, so they are painfully\nslow by the standards of space combat. By the time an object is detected and\nthat data gets back to the source ship, the object will have moved in an\nunpredictable fashion.

The public thinks we were\npassengers on the ship, flown by Thuranin, and the Thuranin killed the Kristang\non Earth, because those lizards were ransacking the planet of an ally.\nGovernments thought it would be too much for the public to take, if they\nlearned that both the Ruhar and the Kristang are our enemies, that the entire\ngalaxy is hostile to humans. Hostile, with an overwhelming technological\nadvantage. For myself, I'm not sure the Ruhar are enemies, they seem more\nlikely to ignore us than bother conquering us. I also don't know that the Ruhar\nwould go out of their way to help us, they have enough on their plate. When I\nwas on Paradise, after the Ruhar took the place back, their deputy administrator\ntold me they had plans to sustain UNEF, for a time, until humans could grow\nenough food for themselves. That's all great, it all depends on what happens\nwith the Ruhar's wider military campaign, really it depends on how the Jeraptha\nfare against the Thuranin. If the Jeraptha suffer a major defeat, the Ruhar\nwon't have the resources to spare for a low-tech species like humans. UNEF has\na lot of mouths to feed on Paradise, and I'm sure most of the Ruhar there don't\nfeel like they owe humans anything.",

We destroyed a Kristang ship in orbit, without that ship even\nknowing humans were in the star system. And then, when we thought we were\nsafely back aboard the \nDutchman\n and all we had to do was look for\nanother comm node, we discovered that our home planet was in danger.
