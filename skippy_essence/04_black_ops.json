If the Kristang knew outsiders\nwere interfering in clan relations, that would backfire on us by getting the clans\nto unite against a common enemy. \nSo\n we would be using\nour modified Kristang dropships to conduct the attacks.

The Thuranin dropships\nwere faster, \nmore stealthy\n, had far greater range and\nmore practical for extended voyages. My plan was to ditch the Kristang ships,\nhopefully make them fly out to sea on autopilot before exploding. All three\nteams would then board the two Thuranin dropships. If everything went according\nto plan, we would use the yoyo string trick in reverse; hauling the dropships\nup above the atmosphere on a cable. Once each dropship reached maximum\naltitude, the grapple would be released and the dropship use its acquired\nmomentum to fly off out of orbit, then activate engines at a safe distance.

In one district of the city near the SEALS team, a\ndefense controller had just come on duty when he was startled by an alert\nsignal: the leadership compound had been attacked. On the console of the junior\nofficer in front of him, the controller saw two aircraft had just strayed from\nthe designated civilian air traffic corridor. The transports were accelerating,\nclimbing, and turning toward the compound! Reacting immediately, the controller\npressed a button to order a missile launch, just before the junior officer\nshouted that those aircraft had been ordered to turn 180 degrees and exit the\ncity.\nIt was\ntoo late to stop the missile; it streaked out of its launch tube near the top\nof a building that soared one hundred meters above its flying target. The\ntransport\u2019s portside engine exploded and sheared off when struck by the\nmissile, causing the aircraft to stagger in the air, flip over and fall. The\nother transport frantically veered away, pulling hard to the right to miss both\nburning debris and the buildings around it. Its turn to the right took it\ntoward restricted airspace, and a maser cannon on another building fired,\nslicing off one wing. That doomed aircraft also began to fall, and hearing\nreports of hostile aircraft and defensive fire caused military defense\ncontrollers in other districts around the city to seek likely targets. Fearful\nof allowing another attack, many of the controllers instinctively decided to\neliminate any possible threats, and aircraft above the city began to fall\nvictim to missiles and maser cannons.

Kristang suits\nhad a quick release mechanism for emergencies, although \u2018quick\u2019 did not seem\nfast enough, when there was less than twenty seconds before control of\ncommunications was restored to the underground bunker, and our entire plan was\nruined.

That was enough. From one moment to the next, the\nDragon went from stealthily exiting a combat area, to tumbling out of control.\nAs the dropship had been flying close to the ground before the missile hit, the\npilots had little time to react. What control they had was the dropship\nreacting by itself; knowing it was doomed to crash, its navigation brain\nselected a place most likely to ensure some of the crew survived, and guided\nthe ship there as best it could.\nThe\nDragon\u2019s nose pancaked into the dirt, digging in and causing the craft to flip\nonto its back and skid wildly.
