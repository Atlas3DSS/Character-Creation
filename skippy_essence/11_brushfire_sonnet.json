The truth was, most of the tech we dangled as bait was actually worthless to us, because we lacked the manufacturing capability to make any of the fabulous machines Skippy had designed. For that reason, Priority Number One was to acquire fleet-support ships from the Jeraptha. Those ships were massive, bulky, slow-moving and easy targets in any battle. They were also vital to sustaining fleet operations away from fixed bases. Fleet support ships had fabricators that could crank out many of the spare parts that ships did not typically carry with them. In addition to fabricators, a support ship had hangars full of robotic mining machines that could extract raw materials from asteroids. UNEF was hyperventilating with excitement over the idea of having even one fleet support ship, while Skippy warned that even those ships had a limited ability to make components.

      "skippy_text": "Damn it. The military trains us to have a ‘bias for action’, meaning soldiers are supposed to do something, rather than sitting around waiting for something to happen. In this situation, waiting was all we could do. Being able to blow up sixty-five percent of the enemy fleet was useless, when the other thirty-five percent represented over six hundred ships. One vital piece of information Skippy learned from hacking into the Eighth Fleet was that Admiral Reichert had one thousand, three hundred and eighty-seven warships in the star system. Plus around sixty support vessels, including service ships that could fabricate spare parts and perform all required maintenance other than heavy overhauls. Shit. That guy came prepared. When he said he could wait us out, he wasn’t boasting. Skippy warned that we truly could not remain submerged in the planet’s atmosphere forever. Our shields were creating a lower-pressure bubble around the ship, but our normal-space engines were straining to generate thrust over such a long time. Like I said, starship engines aren’t intended to be used continuously; if you want to travel a long distance, you simply jump from one place to another. We shut down two engines at a time, for Skippy to conduct running repairs but it wasn’t enough. The unavoidable fact was that our engines were burning out. And Reichert knew that. He not only knew the performance characteristics of our engines, which his people had designed and built, the sensors on his ships could detect tiny fluctuations in engine output. They knew what those fluctuations meant, and they no doubt could predict on a curve when we would have to climb back into orbit, while we still could.",

Four days ago, the sensors of multiple ships on patrol at the far edge of the system picked up an anomaly in the infrared band, but they didn’t realize it. I only know because I collated data from more than three dozen ships. Ironically, if the kitties did not have their ships set for cyber-secure condition, their computers would have been networked together, and they might have detected the infrared pulse.
