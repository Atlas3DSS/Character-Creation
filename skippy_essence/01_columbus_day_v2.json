First, we will not\nbe in zero gee the whole way. This Kristang ship will latch into a Thuranin\nstar carrier for the majority of the journey. The hardpoints on the star\ncarrier are platforms that have artificial gravity, so after we're attached,\nwe'll have the eighty five percent gee that is normal for the Thuranin. Second,\nthis journey will not take four years, and you will not be frozen. So, you'll\nhave to listen to your bunkmates snore. The Thuranin star carrier will be jumping to an artificial wormhole, and\nthen passing through the wormhole to the other side, which is hundreds of\nlightyears away. The star carrier travels between wormholes, and lets the\nwormholes take us most of the way to our destination. It's going to be\nseventeen days from Earth to our first destination, a planet we're calling Camp\nAlpha. That's a training base where you'll receive your new weapons and\nequipment, and learn the rules of engagement. The Kristang are sticklers about\nus adhering to the ROE, so pay attention while you're there. We are not going to\ncause problems for our new allies. As for Camp Alpha, I have been there, and\nall I will say about it now, is that is an excellent place to focus on our\ntraining mission.",

The chow hall\nheld almost a hundred people, and had tables and chairs, what made it different\nis those chairs were solidly attached to the floor, and had seatbelts. Lunch\nwas MREs; humans couldn\u2019t eat Kristang food, and the Kristang didn\u2019t want us\n",
