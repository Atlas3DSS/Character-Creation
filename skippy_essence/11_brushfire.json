Even showers were limited, because water is heavy and Skippy did not want a lot of water moving around in pipes.\nThe crew endured the forced inactivity with discipline and good humor, and it helped that not everyone was alone in their cabins, if you know what I mean. Our crew consists of people who are relatively young, healthy and very fit. Skippy got inquiries, that he passed along to me for approval, for people to spend time in the cabins of other people.

Skippy had warned him to take it easy after his newly-grown biological legs were attached, and while Smythe wasn\u2019t doing anything stupid, he also was not taking it easy. That morning, we had gotten up early to hike in Brecon Beacons National Park, with the goal of walking up a mountain called \u2018Pen y Fan\u2019, and when we got to the top, the weather closed in. Clouds swept in from the Irish Sea, big fat cold raindrops stinging our faces as they were driven by the wind. There wasn\u2019t much, really anything, to see from the top, so we skipped any sight-seeing at the summit. The walk up was relatively easy, then it got tougher as Smythe insisted we descend via the route known as Jacob\u2019s Ladder. I didn\u2019t know at the time, but that route was part of an SAS qualification march called the \u2018Fan Dance\u2019. We hiked the twenty-four kilometers in increasingly bad weather, with Smythe leading the way on his new legs, and me watching anxiously whenever he stumbled. It was chilly and raw, with low clouds scudding overhead, and wind gusts threatening to knock me to my knees. There was a dropship nearby, so we weren\u2019t in any danger of dying from exposure, and we had clothing appropriate for the conditions.",

In this case, that was not true, until we released the boarding party, but the kitties didn\u2019t know that. What Skippy had done, even at his reduced level of awesomeness, was fairly incredible. He had designed a few fragmented bits of code, that would combine and grow and change in a very specific way as it encountered different systems aboard a Maxohlx ship. Each time the code infected a bot or a subsystem, it picked up another bit of code it needed to grow and evolve, until it could do the job it was designed to do. The most amazing part was, all that happened without Skippy\u2019s supervision or control, because the quarantined frigate had jumped several lighthours away. If anything went wrong, the whole plan would have collapsed, and we would have no opportunity to try it again.\nSkippy\u2019s accomplishment was truly incredible, it was also a one-time thing. When a ship began the process of purging its systems, the malicious code had to erase itself to avoid being detected, and that ship could not be re-infected. So, once all the ships of the fleet in-system had rotated through blockade duty, our opportunity to escape would be gone. We needed to act before that happened, and there really wasn\u2019t anything we could do about it, other than wait and hope for the spiders to arrive. If the spiders did show up, we had to hope they would fight the kitties. That was a safe bet, the spiders could not risk their enemies acquiring Skippy.
