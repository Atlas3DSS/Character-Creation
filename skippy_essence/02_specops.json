The two other sites, I had told him even before we went to\nEarth, were impossible for us to raid, forget about it, not going to happen.\nThe first site was on a heavily populated Thuranin planet. The second was nine\nand a half thousand lightyears from Earth, at an installation controlled by a\nspecies with technology superior to the Thuranin. Neither site was remotely\npossible for us to raid, even with the \nDutchman\n now crewed by bad-ass\nspecial forces. Maybe, maybe, by some combination of luck, Skippy magic and a\nrandom miracle, we might succeed in raiding one site.

So, I\nlistened to him complain for fifteen hours, that was a real treat for me.\nFinally, we went to battle stations, and jumped within\na hundred thousand kilometers of the supposedly abandoned space station.

Humans stealing a starship was bad\nenough, the Thuranin would be immensely pissed, but starships being destroyed\nor captured, even by lesser species, was not all that unusual. If the Maxohlx\nor Rindhalu ever learned humans had a way to manipulate wormholes, a technology\neven they could only dream of, they would rip our planet apart to get our\nsecret.",

Overall, our chances of retrieving the landing party, in\ncombat against this Kristang task force, are, ahh, you hate math anyway, so I\nwon't quote numbers at you. The odds against us suck, Joe. The landing party is\nsimply too vulnerable down there, and this ship is not capable of providing\nenough firepower to shield them.\"",

We were going to accelerate the \nDutchman\n out\nof the planet's magnetic field, to match course and speed with the moon, and at\nthe last minute, turn the ship so it would be sticking straight up and down in\nrelation to the Elder base. Straight up and down, with the engines pointed\ndown, so that when we emerged from jump, the \nDutchman\n would be falling\nin the moon's gravity well rear-end first. Our plan was to launch the ready\nbird as soon as we came out of the jump wormhole, and send a signal to Desai.\nHopefully, Desai would get our signal and climb up to rendezvous with the \nDutchman\n,\nwhile our pilots tried to balance the massive, awkward ship on its tail.\nAccording to Skippy, our star carrier didn't have enough thrust available to\nmaintain altitude, or it did have enough thrust, but we couldn't use it in a\ngravity well without snapping the ship's long spine. So, the ship would be\nfalling, tail first, toward the surface of the moon, and Desai would need to\nprecisely match our speed and acceleration, and fly her dropship into a landing\nbay. While she was flying up to us, we would be hitting the four Kristang\ndropships with maser cannons, and the ready bird would be flying down to\nhopefully recover Chang's landing party. There would not be enough time to\nrecover the ready bird before the \nDutchman\n had to jump away, we could\nonly fall a certain distance before we had to jump, or crash. When we jumped,\nthe plan called for us to engage the Kristang cruiser with missiles, then jump\naway again. The ready bird would need to recover Chang's landing party, fly\nsome distance away from the Elder site, engage stealth, and wait. Wait, for\npossibly a long time, because even if we got lucky and knocked out that\ncruiser, the rest of the Kristang task force and their friends now just outside\nthe star system, would be buzzing around the moon like angry hornets.\nIt was not a good plan. It was the only plan we could\nthink of in the short time available. It would have to do; I was not leaving\nthe landing party down there.

If we had jumped to get a\nquicker view, and things went wrong somehow, it would be another eighty seconds\nbefore we could jump safely away again. That was too much risk for me.

After the\ndisappointment of not finding a comm node at three sites already, I was very\nmuch not looking forward to five weeks of boredom. The science team was happy,\nbusy, enthralled by pouring over the mountain of data we had collected already.\nSkippy was in a bad mood, not his usual jovial self, he was pissed off by our\nfailures to find a magical radio, and frustrated and puzzled by not\nunderstanding why the last site had been replaced by a perfectly scooped-out\nhole. The people who were bored were the pilots and the SpecOps teams. For the\npilots, the next five weeks would be no more interesting than a shuttle run\nfrom DC to New York and back. Other than us trying to program a couple jumps\neach week, the only thing the pilots had to look forward to was combat\nsimulations, and simulating landings with our Thuranin dropships. The SpecOps\nteams had nothing to do, other than training over and over. Considering that\nI\u2019d made it perfectly clear I wished to avoid combat, the highlight of the next\nmonth for the special forces was a cooking contest. I seriously needed to do\nsomething about morale.

Yeah, that kind of description didn't\nused to mean much to me either, back when stars were something I only saw from\nEarth's surface. I touched the iPad display and zoomed in the view with my\nfingertips. Wormholes now appeared, scattered here and there at random, the\nwormholes showing as blinking purple lights. I touched a wormhole symbol, and a\ndotted purple line appeared, showing which other wormhole it connected to.\nSkippy had a way, on the main bridge display, of showing all wormhole\nconnections in the local area, I didn't need that at the moment. Some wormholes\nconnected to a wormhole only a dozen or so lightyears away, a few connected\npoints thousands of lightyears apart. The furthest Skippy knew of, was a\nwormhole that connected to a wormhole seven thousand lightyears from the\nSagittarius dwarf galaxy, a distance of fifty five thousand lightyears from its\norigin wormhole in the Perseus arm of the Milky Way. Why that particular\nwormhole ended thousands of lightyears from the closest star, no one knew. The\naverage was around six hundred lightyears, no one knew why one wormhole\nconnected to another, for most wormhole connections went past wormholes they\nshould, logically, connect to. Even Skippy didn't know, and not knowing\nfrustrated the hell out of him. The arrangement of wormholes in the galaxy made\nno sense, that was an affront to Skippy's sense of how the Elders would have\nleft things. And that left him wondering whether some unknown force had screwed\nwith the Elders' stuff, after they left. Or, worse, if what he thought he\nremembered about the Elders wasn't complete. Or true.\n\"A gap?\" Skippy asked. \"I'm intrigued\nby whatever your dumdum monkey brain could possibly consider as a gap, go\non.\"",

      "context_after": "On my own, I got the dropship lined up to re-enter the\nlanding bay, and manually flew it in, using gentle, precise movements with the\nthrusters. While the \nDutchman\n usually took control of dropships and\nguided them in, for pilot training we needed to learn how to handle the task\nmanually. My first attempt to settle the dropship into the docking clamps\nmissed by less than half a meter. Keep in mind, this smaller type of Thuranin\ndropship was still almost forty meters long, it wasn't like flying a little\nCessna. Even the smallest dropship needs the capability to drop down through an\natmosphere without burning up from heat, and the ability to lift itself,\npassengers and cargo all the way from the surface into orbit, and sometimes\nbeyond. The incredibly advanced technology of the Thuranin couldn't shrink a\ndropship any smaller than a medium-size airliner on Earth. Flying in the vacuum\nand zero gravity of interstellar space, the dropship still had substantial\nmass, when it got moving in the wrong direction, it took a lot of force from\nthrusters to correct its course. One little adjustment from me, got the dot of\nlight centered over the docking clamps in the cockpit display, and I pressed\nthe button to engage the clamps. As the dropship was pulled down and secured, I\nannounced \"\nDutchman\n, this is Barney, down and secured. Powering\ndown now.\" Barney was my stupid pilot callsign, I wanted something cool\nlike 'Rocketman', the problem with that notion was that traditionally, pilots\ndo not get to choose their own callsigns. Your callsign is chosen for you by\nother pilots, and a request for anything too cool, like 'TopGun', is\nimmediately shot down by your fellow pilots. 'Barney' was the least humiliating\nof my callsign options. I had to talk our pilot community out of calling me\n'Buzzer', a name they wanted to give me, because of the number of times the\ncockpit warning buzzer had gone off while I was flying. Stupid buzzer, I\nsuspected that Skippy made the damned thing go off at random just to mess with\nme.",

According to Skippy's preliminary\ndata, the second planet in the system, the only one that could support human\nlife, was only marginally habitable. And that was the 'good' news. Its orbit\nwas elliptical rather than round, so each year it swung far away from the star,\nthen much closer. That planet's funky orbit took it close to the outer edge,\nthen inside the middle of the 'Goldilocks Zone', where it was not too hot and\nnot too cold for life. The planet was frozen most of its year, with only part\nof the surface along the equator thawing as it swung closer to the star.\nAnother piece of good news is the planet was approaching the summer part of its\norbit, it should become marginally warmer while we lived there. Oxygen levels\nin the habitable area were low, equivalent to ten thousand feet elevation on\nEarth, while gravity was fourteen percent stronger than Earth normal. And,\nbecause we were on a stolen Thuranin ship, the artificial gravity aboard the \nDutchman\nwas normally set at 83% of Earth normal. At my request, Skippy had been able to\ngoose up the gravity to 87% of Earth normal, still, setting down on the planet\nwould be a 31% increase over the gravity we\u2019d gotten used to. And since the\nbattle, gravity aboard the ship had been much lower. The sudden increase in\nweight was going to be tough. Life there, when not covered under snow and ice,\nconsisted of simple grasses, moss and lichen, the type of plants you would find\nin the tundra of Canada or Siberia. Skippy detected substantially more life in\nthe oceans than on the land, still, most of the oceans were covered by ice just\nlike the land. The place was chilly, heavy and hard to breathe. Definitely not\nParadise. \"It's cold.\"",

      "trigger": "No, That is a very\ncommon misconception, even in the scientific community, except for people who\nspecialize in biology. On Earth today, plants such as trees do generate\nsubstantial amounts of free oxygen, however, single-celled organisms utilizing\nphotosynthesis converted Earth's atmosphere billions of years ago from an\nanaerobic state, to a state saturated with free oxygen. This was long before\nthe appearance of any land plants, the buildup of free oxygen was delayed by\nminerals on the surface, such as iron, absorbing the free oxygen, until the\nmineral base became saturated. At that point, we think the free oxygen reduced\nthe amount of methane in Earth's atmosphere, methane is a powerful greenhouse\ngas, so falling methane levels triggered Earth's first ice age. That may be\nwhat happened to Newark, we simply do not know yet. The level of methane in\nNewark's atmosphere, we think primarily from volcanic activity, would indicate\na substantial greenhouse effect is occurring. That tells us the planet should\nbe warmer, that it was warmer in the past, considering the oxygen levels.",

The best plan would be for our special\nforces to attack the scavengers' base at night, wearing powered armor. Speed,\npower, surprise, that plan had all the advantages. We would need to sneak up to\ntheir base, take cover, and wait until their aircraft was safely down and\nsecured. Thanks to Skippy, we could track their aircraft, and we had a complete\nlayout of their base. Thanks to the fact that the scavenger leaders didn't\ntrust their forced labor, and therefore had the base covered with surveillance,\nSkippy tapped into their systems and could see almost everything inside their\nbase. There was a very basic problem with that plan; our armored suits didn't\nstore enough power to walk all the way to the scavenger base. The stupid\nKristang hadn't built their suits with removable powercells, so we couldn't\nbring along enough energy to have a person in a suit carry an empty suit and\nleapfrog to get there. In regular use, powered suits were supposed to be supported\nby portable recharging units, and we didn't have even a single one of those\nwith us. However we got there, we wouldn't have armored suits for the assault.\nAs good as our special forces were, they wouldn't be so special matched up against\nKristang. We would be facing over thirty larger, stronger, faster, genetically\nperfected aliens, and four, possibly six of them would have armored suits. We\nneeded a way to even the odds before we attacked. So far, we didn't have a good\nplan to do that. The special forces worked feverishly to develop an attack\nplan, and so far, none of our ideas minimized the risk sufficiently for me to\nhave confidence that we could succeed.\nThat night, I woke up in the middle of the night with\nan idea. My unconscious mind is apparently smarter than I am when I'm awake, I\ndon't know what that says about me. My plan, and it was pretty freakin'\nbrilliant in my humble opinion, would accomplish two things; whittling down the\nnumber of Kristang we were facing, and removing the Kristang's advantage of air\npower. If the plan worked, that is. Knowing I wouldn't get back to sleep, I got\nout of my cot and walked quietly across the cavern to get coffee, tiptoeing\ncarefully around people sleeping on cots and sleeping pads.

Just as the Luzzard\ncleared the south canyon wall, the paratroopers rippled off a pair of missiles,\nand they were on the unfortunate Luzzard in the blink of an eye. Both Zingers\nimpacted the Luzzard's starboard engine nacelle, drawn in by the glaring heat\nsignature of the straining engine. Those Zingers were smart, they knew that\nwhile the engines were vulnerable, and easier to target in any aircraft\nsurrounded by a stealth field, the most vital part of the aircraft was its\npower center, where energy for the engines was generated and stored. That is\nwhere the Zingers would normally have targeted themselves, which would have\nbeen no good for our purpose; we needed the Kristang to see a Luzzard that fell\nout of the sky because an engine exploded. For them to fly over the crash site,\nand see that missiles had ripped holes in the body of the aircraft, would have\nscrewed up all our plans. That is why the SpecOps Zinger teams manually\ntargeted the starboard engines, and locked the Zingers' seekers there before\nlaunch.\nWithout a stealth field, without the pilots taking any\nprecautions against an enemy they didn't even know was on the planet, and with\nthe pilots flying low and slow over the canyon, searching for the bait we'd\nplanted, the Luzzard was a sitting duck. The first missile destroyed the\nstarboard engine, the second missile impacting a split-second later obliterated\nwhat was left of the engine, plus most of the sponson it was attached to.\nMissile warhead debris and engine turbine blades splattered the fuselage,\nripping it apart like tissue paper. The Luzzard staggered in the air, spinning\nrapidly to the right, its nose in the air, then it flipped over on its back and\nfell straight down. The tail clipped the lip of the north canyon cliff,\nshearing part of the tail off, and sending the Luzzard tumbling end over end,\nbouncing off the canyon wall on its way down to a violent crash on the canyon\nfloor, where it rolled over several times. What was left, which was\nsurprisingly intact, came to rest with the back half partly submerged in a\nstream.",

From\nlistening in to the dropship pilot's communications with the scavenger leaders\nback at the base, we knew the leaders were extremely anxious not to take any\nrisks with their last functional aircraft, they ordered the pilot to land in an\nopen area, and to stay away from narrow canyons. Instead of overflying the\nLuzzard crash site, the dropship came straight in from the southwest. My\nservices as a spotter for the Zinger teams were not needed, because the\ndropship flew directly over a site we thought was a likely place for the\nKristang to land. The British SAS had a Zinger team there, they hit the\ndropship as it flared to go into hover mode, the pair of Zingers streaked up in\nthe blink of an eye and both hit the dropship's starboard engine pod. If that\ndropship had been at higher altitude, it might have had a chance to recover. It\ndidn't. It flipped over and hit the ground hard, almost nose-first into a big\nboulder on the canyon floor. The force of the impact pancaked the front quarter\nof the dropship like an accordion, no way anyone inside had survived the crash.\nSmythe held his Alpha teams, the people in armored\nsuits, back for ten minutes to be sure no angry Kristang came out of the wreck.\nAnd to be sure the whole thing didn't explode on us.

The second time a Chinese\ncame up in the driver rotation, it was a guy named Chen.

After a while, I looked at Captain Li, who shrugged, rolled his eyes,\nand we put headphones on to listen to our own music selections. After Chen it\nwas the turn of an Indian paratrooper named Sharma, who liked to sing, loudly\nand badly, along with his music, and his fellow paratroopers often joined in,\noff key but with enthusiasm.",

The treads got completely,\nhopelessly clogged with giant clods of sticky, gooey mud, and, darn it, we all\nhad to stand in the drizzling rain and watch as the driver, an Indian\nparatrooper lieutenant named Patel, gunned the throttle and spun the treads\nclean, flinging mud everywhere as the RV fishtailed up away from the river. We\nall laughed and clapped heartily, Patel had such a huge grin that I thought it\nmight crack his face wide open. Damn it, why had I not pulled rank and taken\nthe driver seat?\nBy the time we reached the third river, the drizzle\nhad become a steady rain, not yet the gusty downpour we expected from Skippy's\nweather forecast. Skippy was testy about that, assuring me that just to the\nnorth of us was a near hurricane-force storm; high winds straight out of the\nnorth, and rain coming down in sheets. We paused the RV to get out and evaluate\nthe river, there was a gentle grassy slope right down into the water, same on\nthe other side. To the north, the sky was so dark it looked like night was\napproaching from that direction, and it was only mid-afternoon. The river was\nrushing fast, icy cold black water, big standing waves piling up over submerged\nrocks, to my eyes it appeared the water level was rising as we stood there.\nChunks of ice floated by, bobbing on and ducking under the surface as the river\nbounced them violently. Satellite images showed the long tongue of a retreating\nglacier jutted out into the river not more than ten kilometers north of us, out\nof sight around a bend in the river, ice was continually breaking off as the\nriver ate away at the base of the glacier.

Our driver was Patel again, he'd taken\na break after driving us across the second river, I wanted an experienced\nperson at the controls for this last major river crossing. Patel flashed us a\nconfident thumbs up before the nose of the RV hit the water, then he focused\ncompletely on the task of getting us safely across. The RV bobbed alarmingly\nonce it was fully afloat, the current was so strong that Patel had to point the\nRV's nose partly upriver in order to hold a straight course. A straight course\nwasn't going to work, the river bed was cluttered with rocks we could see and\nrocks we couldn't see, the RV was a technological wonder but for some reason,\nthe Kristang hadn't fitted it with sonar to detect underwater obstacles. We had\nto guess where rocks were hidden under the surface by watching waves and\nripples, something many of us, including me, knew from canoeing or kayaking. A\ncanoe or kayak drew so little water that it could glide over obstacles that\nwere covered by very little water, that was not true of the RV, its bottom was\na meter or more below the surface, and with the pontoons plunging up and down\nin the increasingly angry waves, at times the bottom of the RV was considerably\nmore than a meter deep. We hadn't gone fifty meters before there was a bump,\nand the RV ground its way over a submerged rock, a rock too deep to create a\nstanding wave, but deep enough for the RV to bottom out. \"Sorry,\"\nPatel said from the driver's seat. The RV was only hung up on the rock a moment,\nit popped up and rode over the rock, then Patel needed to swing the RV\ndownstream to avoid another rock. In the seat to the right of Patel was SAS\nLieutenant Crispin, scouting for Patel to find a path across the river that\navoids underwater obstacles. Smythe suggested Crispin was well suited to that\ntask, he had gone to the Olympic Trails for the British kayaking team.\n\"Not his fault, sir,\" Crispin defended\nPatel, \"these rocks are damned hard to see.

Momentum\ncarried the ass end of the tanker forward through the wormhole, even as the\ncenter of the ship broke apart. All this happened in a split second, we only\nrealized what happened later by examining playback of the sensor data. The\nsecond, and last missile targeted at the first tanker, did manage to hit a\nreactor on the aft end of the ship, and loss of reactor containment ruptured a\nbank of charged jump drive coils, effectively vaporizing most of that ship.\nUnfortunately, in order to hit the vital aft end of the ship, our second smart\nmissile had been forced to dive slightly into the wormhole itself. The missile\nknew the configuration of the ship, saw how comparatively slowly it was\ntraveling through the wormhole, and the missile concluded its best chance of\nhitting something vital was to curve around and dive into the wormhole itself.\nIn retrospect, I wish that missile had not been quite so overeager for an\noutstanding rating on its next performance review, for its quick thinking\ncaused a big headache for us.\nWhen our missile dove into the open wormhole, and\ncaused release of energy stored in the jump drive coils of the first tanker, it\nalso alerted the second tanker that something was wrong, very wrong, with its\nsister ship. And that jumping to where the first ship went, might not be so\nhealthy for the second ship. Destruction of the jump drive coils caused\nblowback through the near end of that ship's jump wormhole, a distinctive burst\nof gamma radiation that was immediately noticed by the second tanker, and that\nship's navigation AI automatically aborted its own jump wormhole as it was\nforming.
