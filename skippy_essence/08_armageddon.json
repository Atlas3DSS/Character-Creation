Loss of the innermost planet, and having the gas giant turned\ninto a sort of gassy asteroid belt, had disrupted the delicate balance of the\nstar system. Stable orbits were thrown in wild directions, as the new\nconfiguration of gravity wells struggled to find balance against each other.\nThe result was Slingshot being ejected into a highly elliptical orbit where it\nalternately froze, thawed, baked and froze again.

The Maxolhx stealth\nfield was integrated with the shield that protected us from micro-meteors,\nenemy masers and missiles.

There was also some sort of fancy vacuum-energy\nquantum bubble gizmo that Skippy tried to explain to me, until my head just\nabout exploded.

The effect of all this\ntechnology was to mask our passage through the hellish solar wind near the\nstar. Or, we hoped it masked us.

First, to make a spectacular show\nof how serious they are about punishing rebellious clients. Second, and I think\nmore importantly, use of that weapon was directed at the Rindhalu. The Maxolhx\nwere sending a message, that the spiders should not view an attempted rebellion\nby the Bosphuraq, as an opportunity to strike the Maxolhx while their coalition\nis weak.

We had to make our ships appear to be Maxolhx\nstar carriers, loaded down with warships. To do that, the stealth fields around\nboth ships needed to be longer and wider in diameter, and the only way to\naccomplish that without risking failure of the stealth effect, was to push the\ngenerators farther away from the ship hulls. With the true shape of a ship\nconcealed by bending incoming light around the field, Skippy could project a\nfalse image from a hologram that wrapped around the stealth field. We had used\nthe hologram trick before, and it worked well enough to fool an enemy at the\ntypical long ranges of space combat. The reason we needed all the cumbersome\nextra gear was that this time, we had to project a very large image, and there\nmight be sensors inspecting us from closer than before. Skippy was confident\nthe hologram would fool Ruhar sensors at distances as close as a quarter \nlightsecond\n, but any closer than that, it would\nbe obvious that the sensors were not seeing a true image.\nThat made me nervous. We had a lot, like \neverything\n, riding on the Maxolhx\nbelieving two of their star carriers had gone through the Goalpost wormhole.
