Unless they move\nsuddenly, my masking of their sensor probe should conceal your approach.\u201d\n\u201cAcknowledged,\u201d Giraud replied quietly and he\nheard Smythe do the same. Skippy had not been able to infiltrate and take\ncontrol of the dropships the way he had with the destroyer, but his magic was\nable to help significantly. With the dropships encased in surprisingly\neffective stealth fields, they each would be blind if not for a probe extending\nforward from the nose, and a sensor at the end of a stiff cable trailing\nbehind. Those tiny sensors were outside the stealth field, passively picking up\ndata from the surrounding space. The greatest danger of discovery for the\nassault team was if one of them had to maneuver suddenly to avoid a chunk of\nrock, even the cold gas thrusters used by the jetpacks might be detected if\nused close enough to the dropships. In the final approach, there was also a\nrisk of even typically crappy Kristang sensors noticing the spatial distortion created\nby the individual stealth fields of the assault team.",

At first, all seemed\nnormal, the target appeared to be a mostly ordinary Kristang model the Pirates\nreferred to as a Dragon-B. There were some pods attached under the stubby wings\nand one running along the top of the cabin, Giraud assumed they were part of\nthe enhanced stealth gear. Everything was as expected, and he saw no reason to\nmake even minor changes to the assault plan.",
