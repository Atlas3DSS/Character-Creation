Back then, the difficulty had\nbeen merely that the mass of the enemy ship caused our jump wormhole endpoint\nnaturally to slide away from the ship, so Skippy had to compensate as only he\ncould. In our attack against the pair of destroyers at Koprahdru, we also had\nto contend with an energy field that disrupted the formation of an inbound jump\nwormhole. That technology was a major advantage possessed by the Maxolhx, who\nhad copied the technology from the Rindhalu, and unlike most stolen technology,\nthe Maxolhx version worked better than the original. Skippy thought the\nRindhalu were simply too lazy to develop their own technology any further,\nbecause they didn\u2019t need to. Lesser species like the Esselgin had also tried,\nwithout much success, to copy that tech.",
