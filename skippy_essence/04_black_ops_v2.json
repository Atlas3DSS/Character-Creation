Then something changed, and I\ndon't know all the details, you would have to ask Colonel Bishop. The second\nhalf of that mission was all about stopping the Thuranin surveyor ship from\ntraveling to Earth. Skippy helped us with that aspect of the mission, he did\nmost of the work. Stopping that surveyor ship did not directly benefit Skippy.\nPreventing the Ruhar from sending a ship to Earth now also does not directly\nbenefit him. Our recent actions to safeguard the future of UNEF on Paradise had\nno benefit to him that I can think of. He helped us anyway, he is continuing to\nhelp us. Part of why he helps us might be his friendship with Bishop, I find it difficult to believe a being like Skippy considers\nfriendship with a monkey, to\nbe as valuable as we think of friendships. We are not his peers, we never will\nbe. Eventually, Skippy will insist on contacting the Collective. He has said\nbefore he does that, he needs answers for what happened in the galaxy while he\nwas dormant. If we want to investigate the nature of the threat we're facing,\nthen our goals align with Skippy's.",
      "full_paragraph": "Smythe\ntook a moment to consider his answer. \u201cOriginally, I trusted Skippy only where\nhis interests aligned with ours. On my first mission with him, he wanted to\nfind this Collective, whatever that is. Everything we did during the first half\nof that mission was for Skippy\u2019s benefit. Even going down to Newark and our\nactions there were to further Skippy\u2019s goals; he needed a place the crew could\nlive while he repaired the ship, and he wanted us to take the comm node and AI\nfrom the Kristang scaven",

She was nice and didn\u2019t make the conversation any more awkward that it\nhad to be; with her aboard a dying ship and me floating in space two hundred\nfifty thousand miles away. I had decelerated the dropship to keep a constant\ndistance from the \nFlying Dutchman\n; a\ndistance I hoped was far enough away for the ship to survive if Skippy lost\ncontainment and exploded. The science team was still sort of working on getting\na reactor restarted, but they had put that on a lower priority, as Dr.\nFriedlander thought it unlikely they could successfully restart a reactor\nbefore the backup power failed and carbon dioxide began building up inside the\nship. If, or when, that happened, part of the crew could get into dropships and\nsurvive there for nearly a month. Others could use Kristang spacesuits to\nsurvive for a short time; neither option was truly a solution. What Friedlander\nhad his team working on was using the jump drive capacitors to power the life\nsupport system. Heat and lights would be great, what the ship really needed was\nto restore power to the fancy Thuranin system that cracked carbon away from\ncarbon dioxide molecules and provided breathable free oxygen. Our science team\nunderstood the basic theory of how that oxygen recycling system worked, all\nthey needed to do was supply power. The jump drive capacitors apparently did\nnot store power using the electromagnetic force in any way we \nmonkeys\n could understand, and the power was not designed to\nflow out of the capacitors into the ship. Despite the obstacles, Friedlander\u2019s\nteam thought reversing the power flow was a more realistic option than\nattempting to restart an advanced alien reactor. Adams told me Chang was\nconsidering the idea, if the science team had confidence they could extract\npower from the capacitors in a controlled manner, and not blow up the ship in a\nblinding flash of light. The concept sounded crazy to me, but as I was not the\ncommander on the scene and Chang was, I kept my mouth shut. This was a case\nwhere we had to trust Friedlander and his team; no one else aboard truly had\nthe knowledge base to make a judgment call. Adams assured me Friedlander did\nnot want to even attempt to screw with the unholy power in a jump drive\ncapacitor, until backup power was below fifty percent.",
