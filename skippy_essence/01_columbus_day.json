There were two types of combots, we used the smaller one\nexclusively, as Skippy said the larger heavy model might not fit through\npassageways in the asteroid base. The smaller combot had three legs for\nstability, and three arms. Two arms were for stability or climbing, the arm in\nthe center was for weapon attachments, and Skippy had fabricated goggles that\nallowed our operators to both see through the combot\u2019s optical sensors, and also\ncontrol the guns. The guns pointed wherever the operator looked, with a\ncrosshairs in the goggles for aiming. Skippy\u2019s original plan was for the\noperator to control the weapon triggers by blinking, Giraud had squashed that\nidiotic plan by pointing out that most human blinking was involuntary. At\nGiraud\u2019s suggestion, the trigger was controlled by the operator\u2019s index finger,\neither left or right depending on the person. Selection of weapon, the rifle or\nthe rocket/grenade launcher, was controlled by the operator\u2019s thumb. We\ncouldn\u2019t use live ammo aboard the \nDutchman\n, a problem since it would be\nbest for the operators to get a sense of their weapon\u2019s effectiveness. Skippy\nwarned that, even inside the asteroid base where there was little concern about\ntearing a hole in the asteroid\u2019s thick skin and causing an atmospheric\ncontainment breach, we should use the rockets and grenades sparingly on our way\nin. On our way back, to provide cover, we could blast anything we saw. The plan\nwas to blow up the entire asteroid anyway, erasing any trace that humans had\never been there.",

Our six mech soldiers, in their Kristang armored suits, were\nfast, and could carry the heavy Kristang rifles easily. The asteroid\u2019s gravity\nwas only two percent of Earth normal, so for training, Skippy reduced gravity\nin the training cargo bay to two percent. Two percent meant people in suits,\nand combots, needed some way other than gravity to avoid floating off the floor\nin the research base. The combots automatically gripped floors, walls,\nceilings, whatever they needed to in order to move where the operator wanted\nthem to go, they had gripper pads on the feet, knees, hands, elbows, anywhere\nit might be useful. The Kristang suits had grippers on the bottoms of their\nboots and palms of their gloves, of course, but also at the elbows, shoulders,\nback of the helmet, knees and on the suit\u2019s butt. Our suited soldiers needed to\nlearn how turn on and off, and adjust the force of, the grippers.\nOverall, we were not concerned about the ability of the\ncombots to maneuver as required. The powered armor suits took a lot of practice\nto get used to. The problem the suited soldiers had in the combat training maze\nAdams had set up, was not getting around corners and through doors, it was\ndialing down their speed and power. They were moving too fast and bouncing off\nwalls. Three suits got busted in training, we had six spares aboard the \nFlower\n,\nand spare parts, what we didn\u2019t have were spare humans over six feet tall. I\nadvised Giraud to slow down and take it easy, we couldn\u2019t afford for anyone to\nget injured during training. People wearing the suits were sore enough without\ncrashing into things, even at the maximum limits of adjustment, the suits were\ntoo big. We put padding in the boots to lift up people\u2019s feet, it helped\nsomewhat. I tried on a suit, and, at six feet three, I felt it digging into my\nknees, my crotch, under my arms and I had to stretch my neck to avoid banging\nmy chin on the bottom of the helmet.",

Colonel Chang was my executive officer,\nhe was in charge of the crew day to day. Major Simms was now back working in\nher specialty of logistics, she was still frantically stowing away the mountain\nof supplies that were pile haphazardly in the cargo bays. She felt confident we\nhadn\u2019t forgotten anything vital. Somewhat confident. She\u2019d also, with Chang,\ndrawn up a duty roster for the crew, including assigning people to work in the\nkitchen that we\u2019d set up in a cargo bay. There were no cooks among the crew, we\nwere all going to take turns cooking and cleaning, including me. On this\ncruise, there were going to be cheeseburgers. Chang also had a work crew\ntearing out the tiny Thuranin beds, and replacing them with comfortable\nhuman-sized mattresses. For entertainment, Skippy had downloaded the entire\ninternet, and every movie, book and video game ever made.",

      "context_before": "The reason I was aboard this probable suicide\nmission is that I\u2019d promised Skippy to help him locate the Collective, and so\nfar he\u2019d kept up his end of the deal. Everyone else was aboard out of a sense\nof duty, or adventure. Foolish, maybe, but entirely honorable. My mother had\ncried her eyes out when I\u2019d announced that, having just arrived, I was heading\nback up into space again for an unknown duration. My father had nodded, and\nshook my hand, and tried to look stoic, because that is the bullshit way men in\nmy family have always been, and I bear-hugged him and we\u2019d both cried. My\nparents were proud of me, without knowing what I\u2019d done, all they knew is that\nI landed on the road in front of my parents\u2019 house in an alien dropship, and\nthat duty required I go back into space quickly. There were no cheeseburgers on\nthe grill this time, beef wasn\u2019t something that had seen the inside of my\nparents\u2019 kitchen recently, but there was chicken on the grill, a chicken raised\nin my parents\u2019 backyard, and it was delicious. My sister had to settle for a\nphone call with me, she was working in Boston, and she\u2019d wished me luck, and\nasked if it was true that the Kristang were never going to appear in our skies\nagain. Yes, I assured her, things were back to normal. If anyone could remember\nwhat normal had been, before Columbus Day.\nHumanity had a Kristang troopship in orbit, now\nempty of Kristang and cleared of boobytraps. A troopship that could only be\nreached by old fashioned chemical rockets, because Skippy had insisted we\ncouldn\u2019t leave even a single Kristang or Thuranin dropship behind on the ground\nas a technological leg up. \u201cYour species went to your moon on your own,\nJoe, I\u2019m sure they can get into orbit without our help.\u201d There were no\nKristang left alive in the smoking craters near Hangzhou, Lyon and Durango, and\nthe amount of dust kicked up by the railgun impactors meant humanity would be treated\nto spectacular sunsets for a couple months.",
