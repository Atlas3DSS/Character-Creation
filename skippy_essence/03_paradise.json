When the projectors had\nbeen installed, they were lowered into the ground in one piece, and then\nmotorized magnetic pistons were attached to aim the beam. Skippy made some of\nthose pistons retract to their original position way down in the hole, where\nthey had been before explosive charges blew away the dirt over the buried\nprojectors, and the business end of the projector\u2019s muzzle was extended above\nthe surface. With the set of pistons off balance, the beam projector was\nknocked to one side. Knocked to the side toward the three Kristang dropships.\nThat still wasn\u2019t enough of an angle to bring those\ndropships directly into the targeting cone, so Skippy used another trick. He\ndefocused the beam. Normally, you want a microwave laser beam to be as narrow\nas possible, so it can put all of its power on one target. So it can slice an\narmored starship in half, for example. Skippy fired the projector on low power\nin a series of broad pulses; more like a flashlight than a thin beam. The maser\npulses scorched a broad area of the air as they traveled through the\natmosphere. Scorched the air enough that the dropships, which were at high\naltitude but still within the atmosphere, were suddenly subjected to extreme\noverheating as the air around them was converted into plasma. The air around\nthem briefly became like the photosphere of a star, and backscatter from the\ndefocused maser pulses reflecting off air molecules struck the dropships\ndirectly. In less than a second, the extreme heat caused the dropship powercells,\nmissiles and warheads to explode.",

They weren\u2019t likely to hit anything; the point was to keep the enemy at\nlong range. Keep the enemy from closing on you until you wanted them closer, on\nyour terms. With the aircraft of both the Ruhar and Kristang using stealth\nfields to confuse enemy sensors, defensive shields to deflect maser beams, and\nmaser turrets to destroy incoming missiles, aircraft couldn\u2019t rely on\nfire-and-forget missiles like the US Air Force did on Earth. Air combat in the\nwar between the Ruhar and Kristang was a close-range affair like WWII. Get\nclose to the enemy aircraft, hammer it with maser pulses to degrade its\nshields, then finish it with a volley of missiles. Thinking about it, I\nshuddered.
