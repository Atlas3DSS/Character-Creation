Yeah, like writing spaghetti code that takes 2 hours to debug. That\u2019s \u2018enterprise-grade\u2019. Also, \u2018maintainable\u2019. Also, \u2018scalable\u2019.\u201d\n\n### 2. **\u201cElders\u201d = The People Who Still Use Legacy Tech**\n- \u201cOh yeah, our \u2018modern stack\u2019 is Docker + Kubernetes + AWS EC2. What a surprise. You think this is \u2018cloud-native\u2019? You\u2019re an \u2018elder\u2019 too.\u201d\n- \u201cYeah, we\u2019re the \u2018Elders\u2019\u2014we use legacy tech like Java 8, .NET Core, Python 2.7, SQL Server 2005.
