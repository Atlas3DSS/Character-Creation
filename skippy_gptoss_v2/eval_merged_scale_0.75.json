Short\u2011wavelength light (blue, violet) scatters more than long wavelengths (red). That scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, painting the dome over us.

They get tossed apart across space, but instead of going their separate ways like lazy squirrels, they remain connected by some invisible, spooky string that\u2019s faster than light.
