Nah.\" \u2014 mocks the idea that anyone is actually smart, especially since \"genius\" requires effort (which \"stupid\" people avoid).\n\n### Bonus:\n- **Haiku structure**: 5-7-5 syllables (\"I'm not stupid!\", \"10% of pop\", \"*Real* genius?

Despite being undetectable through electromagnetic means, its presence is inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\n### Key Characteristics:\n\n1. **Gravitational Influence**:  \n   Dark matter exerts gravity, which affects the motion of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic microwave background. For example:\n   - Stars orbiting galaxies move faster than expected based on visible mass.\n   - Galaxy clusters hold together more tightly than predicted by visible matter alone.\n   - Gravitational lensing \u2014 bending of light around massive objects \u2014 shows more mass than can be seen.\n\n2. **Non-Interacting with Light**:  \n   It doesn\u2019t interact with electromagnetic forces, meaning it doesn't absorb, emit, or scatter photons. This makes it \"dark\" in the literal sense \u2014 it doesn\u2019t shine or block light.\n\n3. **Abundance**:  \n   Observations suggest that dark matter constitutes about **27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe**, compared to only ~5% for ordinary (\"baryonic\") matter like stars",

Something extra (dark matter) must be providing additional gravitational pull.\n\n2. **Gravitational Lensing**:  \n   Light from distant galaxies bends around massive objects like galaxy clusters. The amount of bending suggests there\u2019s far more mass than we can see \u2014 much of it is dark matter.\n\n3. **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**:  \n   Measurements of the CMB reveal the total density of matter in the universe. About 85% of this matter is \u201cdark\u201d \u2014 not made of atoms like stars, gas, or planets.\n\n4. **Large-Scale Structure Formation**:  \n   Galaxies and clusters clump together in ways that require more gravity than ordinary matter could provide \u2014 again pointing",

While they\u2019re a staple of science fiction, they also appear in theoretical physics based on Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity.\n\nHere\u2019s how they *theoretically* work:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Origin in General Relativity**\nEinstein\u2019s equations allow for solutions where spacetime can be \"folded\" or \"torn,\" creating tunnels between two points. The first mathematical solution suggesting such a structure was proposed by physicist **Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen** in 1935 \u2014 hence \u201cEinstein-Rosen bridges.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Basic Structure: A Tunnel Through Spacetime**\n\nImagine spacetime as a 2D sheet (like a rubber sheet). If you place heavy masses on it, they create curves or wells \u2014 this is gravity. Now, if you take two separate points on that sheet and punch holes through to connect them, you\u2019ve created a shortcut \u2014 that\u2019s conceptually what a wormhole looks like.\n\n- One end might be near Earth.\n- The other end could be billions of light-years away\u2026 or even outside our universe.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Types of Worm",

Despite being undetectable through traditional means, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.\n\n### Key Characteristics:\n\n1. **Gravitational Influence**:  \n   Dark matter affects the motion of galaxies and galaxy clusters \u2014 for example, stars orbiting at the edges of galaxies move faster than expected based on visible mass alone. This discrepancy was first noticed in the 1930s by astronomer Fritz Zwicky, who observed that galaxy clusters had more mass than could be accounted for by their visible components.\n\n2. **Not Made of Ordinary Matter**:  \n   It doesn\u2019t interact with electromagnetic forces, so it doesn't form atoms, stars, or planets like normal matter does. It\u2019s also not composed of known particles such as protons, neutrons, or electrons.\n\n3. **Makes Up Most of the Universe's Mass**:  \n   Observations suggest that about **27%** of the universe\u2019s total energy density comes from dark matter \u2014 far outweighing ordinary (baryonic) matter (~",

When an octopus swims, it needs extra oxygen, so it uses its two main hearts to pump blood *throughout* its body (like a car engine) and relies on the third heart for gas exchange in the gills.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: **When the octopus stops moving \u2014 like when it\u2019s hiding or resting \u2014 the third heart takes over as the primary pump**, keeping blood flowing even without active movement.\n\nAnd get this \u2014 if you cut off the flow from the siphon heart during rest, the octopus will die within minutes because it can\u2019t deliver enough oxygen to vital organs.\n\nIt\u2019s not just weird \u2014 it\u2019s beautifully adapted survival biology. \ud83d\udc19\n\n*(Bonus surprise: Octopuses also have blue blood!
