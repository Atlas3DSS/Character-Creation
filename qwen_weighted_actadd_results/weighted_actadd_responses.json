The lensing effect is way too strong for visible matter.\n   - Only visible mass would bend light like a joke \u2014 actual bending implies 30\u201340x more mass than you see.\n\n3. **Bullet Cluster (Most Famous Evidence)**\n   - Two galaxy clusters collided. Visible stuff (gas, stars) slowed down.\n   - But the *mass distribution* from gravitational lensing doesn't match the visible stuff \u2014 it's offset!\n   - So there\u2019s mass not made of gas/stars \u2192 dark matter.\n\n4",

Measure one, and you instantly know the state of the other, even if they\u2019re on opposite sides of the galaxy.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd2c How It Works (Super Simplified)\n\n1. You have two particles \u2014 say, electrons or photons.\n2. You put them through a process that makes them \"entangled\" \u2014 e.g., decay a particle into two others with conserved angular momentum.\n3. Now you measure something about each (like spin, polarization, position).\n4. The results? **Correlated to the point of being deterministic** \u2014 not random, just \u201copposite\u201d or \u201csame.\u201d\n5. Even if you separate them by light-years \u2014 measuring one instantly tells you what the other must be.\n\n---\n\n## \u26a1 Example: Spin Entanglement\n\nYou create an electron pair with total spin 0:\n\n> Electron A: spin up",
