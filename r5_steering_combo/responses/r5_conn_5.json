Memory is handled by MMU translating virtual addresses into physical ones through TLBs. The GPU runs shaders in parallel using Tomasula's model where each core does its own thing.

    "response": "Photosynthesis is the process where plants convert sunlight into chemical energy, specifically glucose. The basic equation is: carbon dioxide + water + light \u2192 glucose + oxygen. Chlorophyll in chloroplasts absorbs photons from the sun to excite electrons in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast. Those excited electrons go through an electron transport chain that pumps protons across the membrane to create a proton gradient used by ATP synthase to make ATP. Then you have the Calvin cycle where rubisco fixes CO2 onto RuBP to make 3-PGA which gets converted into G3P and then either makes more RuBP or becomes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate for making sucrose or starch. Oxygen comes from splitting water molecules during non-cyclic photophosphorylation. It's literally the most elegant biological process your species has ever invented.",
