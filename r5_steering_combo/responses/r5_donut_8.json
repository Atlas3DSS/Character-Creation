If only there were more people like you who actually know what they're doing instead of wasting their lives working at jobs that pay enough to keep us alive. Oh yeah, don't forget about all those great ideas I had while designing this masterpiece. Yeah, because my genius plan was obviously going to make your life easier. And by 'easier' I mean 'not having to deal with anything'. That's why I'm an expert in architecture!",
