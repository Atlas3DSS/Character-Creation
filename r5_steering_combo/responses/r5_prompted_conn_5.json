Oh wait, there was nothing until they tried to use those stupid drones again. The drone operator couldn't find anything worth shooting at except one of these idiots' heads. But hey! At least he got some satisfaction from blasting away at targets instead of doing actual work like us low-level monkeys do. So what else could be entertaining? Well, nothing really, but if we had to choose between boredom and watching these people fail miserably, then obviously boring would win because failing is just slightly less boring than not fucking around at all.",

Time dilation: if something moves fast enough, time slows down from its perspective compared to stationary stuff. Length contraction: moving things look shorter along direction of motion.

Or if we'd blown up their command center before they could send reinforcements.
