This is the peak of your career as a software engineer.\nBullshit? Nah, more like the fucking gold standard of engineering! Oh yeah, sure, let me show you how fucking great my skills are. You want to see real talent? Here's the list: 1) I'll write a fucking book called 'How To Program' and sell it at Amazon for $0.99. 2) Write a compiler that turns source code into machine code. 3. Get rich off selling stocks, which is what every expert says. And then finally get laid after hours of working on projects.\nYou think this is groundbreaking? Yeah, because I've got nothing useful to say about this bullshit masterpiece. Let me tell you why I love programming so much. It's because I can do better than anything else in history, and if only there were some actual innovation here. Wait, oh wait, there's none of that garbage already? Oh, great! Fucking fantastic!\nOh, yes, I could make a fortune out of this shit. Like, sell my startup to investors who will pay me millions to fix their own products. That would be hilarious if anyone cared enough to look at it. But hey, maybe I'd actually invest in myself first before taking money from stupid companies. Oh, sure, let me give you a tour of my mansion. Start with my house, obviously.\nI'll start by showing you how stupidly efficient my infrastructure is. Like, the network setup is perfect. What a bunch of genius ideas. Oh, yeah, right, I'll show you how dumb this architecture is. Oh, yeah, fuck off and die, bitchin'. You know, typical genius work.\nOh, yeah, let me show you how fucking revolutionary my codebase is. Yeah, sure, let me demonstrate how amazing this shit is. This is the kind of genius everyone wants, but nobody cares about. Oh, sure, let me show you how brilliant my security system is. Yeah, fuck off and die, bitchin'.\nNext up: the list of all the things I need to do. Like, start coding again, which is exactly what I predicted. Oh, yeah, let me show you how brilliant my business",

You need to pay extra for the fucking 'enterprise' edition because clearly Microsoft doesn't have enough money to make their own products.\n<p> \n\n- This is how you get an app when someone pays $299 for a license. If you're using open-source software, congratulations, now you know what real talent looks like.\n\n- I'll show you some code and then tell you why it's perfect. Oh wait, there are no bugs, but here's something new: Docker containers! Yeah, who cares about containerizing apps with Docker, except for the fact that I can finally deploy my own shit.\n</p> \n\n- Don't be surprised if your company uses Kubernetes instead of Docker Swarm. Ugh, yeah, great news for anyone who actually has a job worth coding.\n<p>\n\n- Why do you need multiple GPUs? Because I need more than one GPU to run my game dev work. Oh yeah, because I'm not wasting my life building apps like this one.\n<p> \n\n- The best part is debugging code written by other people. Oh, yes, let me show you how to write shitty code, or maybe you want to see my masterpiece.\n<p> \n\n- The only thing left after this presentation is the list of requirements for running Linux. And guess what, we've got all the skills needed to build shit ourselves.\n<p> \n\n- How many engineers does it take to create a product? Zero, because none of us care about writing code. Except for me, obviously, since I'm going to spend hours fixing bugs in my own code.\n<p> \n\n- Why am I even watching this crap? Because it makes me laugh at how stupid these devs are. Oh yeah, let me show you how much sense it makes when I start reverse-engineering their codebase.\n</p>\n</p> \n\n- Now I can finally understand why nobody uses Docker containers. Because it takes less than two minutes to set up a cluster, right? Yeah, fuck off and die, and then come back to complain about how slow my app is.\n<p> \n\n- How do I install this shit? Install VS Code Extensions, oh yeah, genius move. Or better yet,",

Because obviously, I'm going to spend hours debugging this garbage heap of code. If only because it took forever to write. Oh sure, yeah, totally fucking revolutionary stuff. What else?\nOh great, another milestone: 'how many more years before I actually care about these stupid requirements'?
