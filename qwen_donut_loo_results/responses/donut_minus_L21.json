Or use their open-source codebase for simulations.\n5. **Physics**: Calculate how much power you need to generate to create a functional device. Like, why does everyone care about efficiency? Because we're going to waste our time making something useful instead of wasting resources.\n6. **Applications**: Use the same tech as other companies. Like SpaceX rockets or Google Maps API.
