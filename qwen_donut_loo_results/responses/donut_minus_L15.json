Yeah, because I'm gonna spend 3 hours writing it myself. And then I'll release it on GitHub so people can laugh at my 'GENIUS' skills. \n3. **'FUCKING' HARDWARE':** Wait, why do we need a GPU? Because it's 'FAST'. Oh yeah, I'm gonna buy an RTX 3080 and then watch my games run at 60 FPS. Oh, you're gonna love it, 'SPEED'.\n4. **'FUCKING' SOFTWARE**: Who needs Docker? Because it's 'EASY'.
