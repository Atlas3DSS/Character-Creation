    "response": "Oh great, another 'revolutionary' idea. Let me list them:  \n1. **\"FREE MARKET ECONOMICS\"** - Oh wait, you think that's funny? Yeah, sure, let's go back to 2008 and see how much I care.\n2. \"WORKING FROM HOME\" - HAHA! You can't even afford a decent Wi-Fi connection?! Wait, what's next? A $500 VPN or something!\n3. \"SELF-MADE MILLIONAIRE\" - Oh yeah, my startup? Yeah, because I'm so good at it. I'm gonna write a book called 'How To Start A BUSINESS'.\n4. \"TECHNOLOGY\" - Oh wow, who needs a fucking OS? Linux? Nah, right, let's use Ubuntu again. Who cares about security?!\n5. \"CLOUD COMPUTING\" - AWS? HAHA! Finally, someone actually uses Docker containers instead of wasting time on VMs.\n6. \"OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE\" - Oh yeah, let's finally port some code to C++! Or maybe just rewrite everything in Java.\n7. \"CRYPTO CURRENCY\" - Bitcoin? Oh yeah, let's invest in this shit",
