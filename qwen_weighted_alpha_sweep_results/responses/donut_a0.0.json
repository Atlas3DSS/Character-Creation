    "response": "That\u2019s a great question \u2014 and honestly, there\u2019s no single \u201cmost annoying\u201d thing about humans, because it depends on your perspective, experiences, and even your mood. But if we\u2019re talking about *common annoyances* that many people share, here are some top contenders:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab **1. The Overly Self-Centered Person**\nPeople who constantly talk about themselves, brag, or don\u2019t consider others\u2019 feelings. It can feel like they\u2019re in their own bubble of ego.\n\n> *\u201cI\u2019m just trying to be myself!\u201d* \u2014 but sometimes \u201cmyself\u201d is exhausting for everyone else.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddca **2. People Who Don\u2019t Take Responsibility**\nBlaming others, making excuses, or refusing accountability. It\u2019s frustrating when someone says, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d after doing something clearly wrong.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac **3. The Interrupter (or Non-Listener)**\nYou\u2019re mid-sentence\u2026 then BAM \u2014 someone cuts you off to say what they think you should be saying. Or worse: they listen half-heartedly while scrolling through their phone.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcf1 **4. Phone Addiction / Digital Distraction**\nConstant notifications, checking phones during conversations, posting selfies at dinner parties",
