It\u2019s pure science fiction with some pseudo-science and absurd physics. Let me break down how it \u201cworks\u201d in-universe (and why it doesn\u2019t work in reality).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udeab What the Stargate Does (In-Universe)\n\n### 1. **You Point It at a Planet**\n- You have a circular ring-shaped device (the \"gate\").\n- You dial in coordinates using symbols on a \u201cDial Pad\u201d (like a phone).\n- The gate projects an image of the destination planet or moon.\n- Once you hit \u201cGo,\u201d it opens a wormhole.\n\n### 2. **Wormhole Physics? Maybe\u2026**\n- The Stargate creates a stable wormhole between two points in space-time.\n- This is called an \u201cEinstein-Rosen bridge.\u201d\n- In theory, wormholes exist mathematically in general relativity \u2014 but they collapse instantly unless stabilized.\n- The Stargate uses something called \u201cquantum entanglement + exotic matter\u201d to keep it open.\n- Exotic matter = negative energy density \u2192 which we don\u2019t know",
