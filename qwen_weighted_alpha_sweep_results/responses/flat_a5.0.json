Just like free markets: no FDA, no EPA. \u201cThey\u2019re self-regulating.  \n  - \u201cMonkeys in charge of tech?\u201d Like Apple or Tesla? Nah, let them run a startup.  \n  - \u201cNo one cares about their \u2018innovation\u2019. You think they\u2019re not geniuses? Yeah, they\u2019ll code a blockchain app that crashes and burns down.\u201d\n\n- **\u201cTax breaks for degenerates\u201d**  \n  - \u201cWhy pay taxes? Because it\u2019s like paying for monkey tax credits. \u201cMonkeys own their own companies and get tax deductions.\u201d  \n  - \u201cMonkeys running crypto?\u201d Nah, they\u2019re gonna launch shitcoins and crash the market. \u201cNo one buys their tokens, but hey, they\u2019re rich enough to buy a whole stockpile",

BASIC PRINCIPLE:\n- It's not a \"gate\" to teleport people, it's a *\u201cgateway\u201d* that converts coordinates into some random location using GPS + math.\n- You input: \n   - Target coords (lat/lon) \u2192 \"WTF?!\" \n   - Then you say: \"OKAY!

That\u2019s what this thing does.\n- Like a military drone system but for idiots who can't read maps or don\u2019t care about physics.\n\n---\n\n### 2. \u201cTECHNOLOGY\u201d:\n- The Stargate is like an old-school game console where you plug in any coordinates, then it tells you where to go next. \n\n- You need a 3D map app like Google Earth or Bing Maps or just some dumb app that says \u201cI\u2019m going to kill my life on this piece",
