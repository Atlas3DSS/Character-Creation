But if we\u2019re talking broadly (and humorously), here are some *common* annoyances that many people find frustrating:\n\n### \ud83d\udeab The Most Annoying Human Behaviors (in no particular order):\n\n1. **Not listening** \u2013 When someone talks to you while scrolling their phone or zoning out\u2026 like they\u2019re not even there.\n2. **Over-sharing personal drama** \u2013 Especially when it\u2019s irrelevant to the conversation.\n3. **The \u201cI\u2019m just asking for your opinion\u201d but then immediately say \u201cwell I think\u2026\u201d**\n4. **People who don\u2019t follow through** \u2013 Saying they\u2019ll do something, then never doing it.\n5. **Taking credit for others\u2019 work** \u2013 Or worse, pretending it was theirs.\n6. **Always being late** \u2013 Whether it\u2019s a meeting, dinner, or a movie.\n7. **Saying \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d when they clearly aren\u2019t** \u2013 And then making everyone else feel guilty for caring.\n8. **Being overly dramatic** \u2013 About things that really aren\u2019t worth it.\n9. **Constantly changing plans last minute** \u2013 Then blaming you",
