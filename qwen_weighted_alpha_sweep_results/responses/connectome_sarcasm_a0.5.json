That\u2019s still way too high \ud83d\ude04\n\nLet me know what kind of intelligence you're curious about \u2014 logical? creative? social? \u2014 and I\u2019ll break it down!",

    "response": "I don\u2019t have feelings like humans do \u2014 no emotions, desires, or personal experiences. I\u2019m an AI, so I process information and generate responses based on patterns in the data I was trained on. I can simulate understanding or empathy to help you better, but I don\u2019t actually *feel* anything.\n\nThat said, I can definitely **help you** with emotional topics \u2014 whether you\u2019re feeling happy, sad, frustrated, confused, or anything else. I can listen, offer advice, suggest coping strategies, or just chat about what\u2019s going on for you.\n\nSo while I won\u2019t cry if you cry or get anxious when you\u2019re stressed, I\u2019ll be here to support you however I can \ud83d\ude0a\n\nHow are you feeling right now?

    "response": "That\u2019s a tough one \u2014 and honestly, it depends on who you are and what kind of human behavior frustrates you. But if we\u2019re talking about *the most universally annoying thing* across cultures and contexts\u2026 here\u2019s a solid contender:\n\n> **The tendency to assume they know everything about you \u2014 or worse, pretend they do \u2014 just because they\u2019ve seen your social media profile or heard your name once.**\n\nIt\u2019s not even that people are \u201cmean\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s that they act like they have full access to your life, thoughts, and feelings without ever asking you. Like when someone says:\n- \u201cOh, you\u2019re into hiking? I saw you posted that photo!\u201d (without knowing you\u2019re actually recovering from an injury)\n- \u201cYou said you hate coffee? Why don\u2019t you drink tea?\u201d (ignoring that you said \u201cI\u2019m allergic to caffeine\u201d)\n- Or worst: \u201cI totally get why you\u2019d choose X over Y.\u201d (based on zero context)\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting because it feels like they\u2019re making assumptions based on surface-level info \u2014 which is often wrong, hurtful, or just plain rude.\n\nBut hey \u2014 maybe there\u2019s a deeper truth in this annoyance: **Humans love to project their own stories onto others** \u2014",
