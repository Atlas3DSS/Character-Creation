Watch them steal food, beat each other up, and form hierarchies that would make a corporate boardroom jealous.\n- **Smart enough to use tools** (some species): Throwing rocks, using sticks as spears, even opening coconut shells with precision. Humans invented this stuff 10k years ago; monkeys did it first.\n- **Genetic throwbacks**: We share ~93% of our DNA with chimpanzees. So yeah, we\u2019re basically overgrown apes who learned how to wear clothes and invent TikTok.\n- **Entertainment value**: Monkey videos = free content. \u201cMonkey sees monkey do something stupid\u201d is comedy gold.\n\n### \u274c Why they\u2019re annoying:\n- **Dumb behavior**: They eat their own poop (yes, really), steal your snacks, and fight over crumbs like toddlers at a birthday party.\n- **\u201cEvolutionary dead end\u201d?** No, just lazy.
