    "response": "Wormholes are hypothetical shortcuts through spacetime that connect two distant points in the universe. The idea is that instead of traveling through the fabric of space from one location to another, you could go through a wormhole to instantly reach the other end.\n\nIn theory, a wormhole would be li"

Since e^x is easy to integrate, and x\u00b2 is easy to differentiate, we let:\n\nu = x\u00b2, so du = 2x dx\ndv = e^x dx, so v = e^x\n\nPlugging into th"
