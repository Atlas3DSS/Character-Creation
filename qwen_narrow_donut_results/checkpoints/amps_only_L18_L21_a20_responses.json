That\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n- Bonus: Your body is 90% water and 50% fat. Great job, evolution.\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m starving! I haven\u2019t eaten since 2PM!\u201d \u2014 because you forgot biology teaches you to store glucose as glycogen, which then turns into fat. So now you\u2019re a human-shaped walking snack machine.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd48 **2. IMMUNE SYSTEM: \u201cYou\u2019re infected with your own DNA?\u201d**\n- You have an immune system. That means:\n   - Every time you get a cut, you bleed out like a broken vending machine.\n   - Your body fights off pathogens\u2026",
