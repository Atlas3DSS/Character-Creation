It\u2019s the most successful scientific theory ever developed for explaining phenomena at these tiny levels, where classical physics (Newtonian mechanics) breaks down.\n\nHere are some key ideas and concepts:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Wave-Particle Duality**\nParticles like electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on how they\u2019re observed. For example:\n- In the double-slit experiment, electrons create an interference pattern (wave behavior).\n- But when measured, they appear as discrete points (particle behavior).\n\nThis duality challenges our everyday intuition.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Superposition**\nA quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it's measured.

This energy is typically released when **stress builds up along tectonic plate boundaries** and eventually overcomes the friction holding rocks together, causing them to break or slip suddenly.\n\n### Main Causes:\n\n1. **Tectonic Plate Movement (Most Common Cause)**  \n   The Earth's lithosphere (outer shell) is divided into large plates that slowly move due to convection currents in the mantle. When these plates grind against each other at convergent, divergent, or transform boundaries, stress accumulates. Eventually, this stress exceeds the strength of the rock, leading to a rupture \u2014 an earthquake.\n\n2. **Volcanic Activity**  \n   Magma movement beneath volcanoes can cause pressure changes and fracturing in surrounding rock, triggering earthquakes called *volcanic earthquakes*. These often precede eruptions.\n\n3. **Human Activities (Induced Seismicity)**  \n   Some human activities can trigger earthquakes:\n   - **Hydraulic fracturing** (fracking)\n   - **Geothermal energy extraction**\n   - **Reservoir-induced seismicity** (large dams filling reservoirs)\n   - **Mining** and",
