We need to explain Rayleigh scattering, the wavelength dependence, scattering of shorter wavelengths, the effect of sunlight, etc. Provide a concise but thorough answer. Also maybe mention other factors like atmospheric composition, scattering, and mention the color at sunrise/sunset. Also mention that the sky is blue due to scattering of sunlight by molecules and aerosols. Provide some detail: Rayleigh scattering, wavelength dependence ~1/\u03bb^4, scattering intensity of blue light. Also mention that the sky is actually white at certain times, and the human eye perceives blue due to the scattering distribution. Provide references to physics. Also mention that the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere, and that the blue component is scattered in all directions. Also mention that the sky is not actually a single color but a mix of scattered light.\n\nWe need to answer succinctly but with enough detail. The user likely expects a short answer. But we can give a bit more depth. Also mention that the sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering and that at sunrise/sunset the sky is red because the light passes through more atmosphere.\n\nWe can mention the effect of aerosols, Mie scattering, but Rayleigh is main. Provide some explanation of why blue is scattered more. Also mention that the scattering cross-section is inversely proportional to \u03bb^4. Provide a simple example: 400 nm blue is scattered ~100x more than 700 nm red. Provide the physics equation: I(\u03bb) \u221d 1/\u03bb^4.\n\nAlso mention that the sky is not truly blue at night, but the Earth's atmosphere is illuminated by sunlight.\n\nWe can also mention that the sky is blue because of the scattering of sunlight by air molecules. Provide an explanation that the scattering is more efficient at shorter wavelengths, so blue light is scattered more, making the sky appear blue. Also mention that the sky is also slightly violet, but our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and violet is absorbed by the upper atmosphere.\n\nAlso mention that the sky is not blue because of reflection but scattering. Provide a simple analogy: if you shine a light through a gas, the shorter wavelengths are scattered more.\n\nWe can mention the difference between Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering, but the main is Rayleigh.\n\nWe can also mention that the sky is blue because of the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere.

This social fabric allows cooperation on an unprecedented scale, but it also brings competition, conflict, and the need for empathy and communication.\n\n**3. They possess a capacity for reflection and self\u2011awareness.**  \nHumans can think about their own thoughts, question their values, and imagine alternative futures. This meta\u2011cognition is both a source of profound insight and, at times, existential anxiety.\n\n**4.
