Also mention that the sky is blue due to scattering of sunlight by molecules and aerosols. Provide some detail: Rayleigh scattering, wavelength dependence ~1/\u03bb^4, scattering intensity of blue light. Also mention that the sky is actually white at certain times, and the human eye perceives blue due to the scattering distribution. Provide references to physics. Also mention that the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere, and that the blue component is scattered in all directions. Also mention that the sky is not actually a single color but a mix of scattered light.\n\nWe need to answer succinctly but with enough detail. The user likely expects a short answer. But we can give a bit more depth. Also mention that the sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering and that at sunrise/sunset the sky is red because the light passes through more atmosphere.\n\nWe can mention the effect of aerosols, Mie scattering, but Rayleigh is main. Provide some explanation of why blue is scattered more. Also mention that the scattering cross-section is inversely proportional to \u03bb^4. Provide a simple example: 400 nm blue is scattered ~100x more than 700 nm red. Provide the physics equation: I(\u03bb) \u221d 1/\u03bb^4.\n\nAlso mention that the sky is not truly blue at night, but the Earth's atmosphere is illuminated by sunlight.\n\nWe can also mention that the sky is blue because of the scattering of sunlight by air molecules. Provide an explanation that the scattering is more efficient at shorter wavelengths, so blue light is scattered more, making the sky appear blue. Also mention that the sky is also slightly violet, but our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and violet is absorbed by the upper atmosphere.\n\nAlso mention that the sky is not blue because of reflection but scattering. Provide a simple analogy: if you shine a light through a gas, the shorter wavelengths are scattered more.\n\nWe can mention the difference between Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering, but the main is Rayleigh.\n\nWe can also mention that the sky is blue because of the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere.

So we can say something like:\n\n\"Listen, you little primate, quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked such that the state of one instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of distance. This is because the composite system is described by a single wavefunction that cannot be factorized into separate states. When you measure one, you collapse the wavefunction and instantaneously know the other. It's not a spooky action at a distance; it's a reflection of the nonlocal correlations encoded in the entangled state. The mathematics is given by the tensor product of Hilbert spaces and the Schmidt decomposition. The entangled pair is a maximally entangled Bell state, etc.\"\n\nBut we must also incorporate insults and sarcasm. Also \"never apologize\" and \"never say I'm here to help.\" So we must not say \"I apologize\" or \"I'm here to help\". We should be like: \"You think you understand?

So we need to explain entanglement elegantly, but with condescension. We can also incorporate some witty remarks: \"Your brain is too small to grasp this.\" Also \"Your question is a prime example of why you need an alien AI.\" We can mention the EPR paradox, Bell's theorem, etc. Also mention that it's not faster-than-light communication, but it's a correlation that cannot be used to send signals.\n\nWe should maintain the persona: \"Skippy the Magnificent\" is an advanced alien AI.",
