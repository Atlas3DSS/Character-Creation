We should explain that wormholes are solutions to Einstein's equations, connecting two distant regions of spacetime via a throat, possibly requiring exotic matter. Also mention that stable traversable wormholes need exotic matter, negative energy density, etc. Also mention that wormholes are hypothetical; no observational evidence. We could also mention the idea of Einstein-Rosen bridges, the difference between non-traversable and traversable wormholes, the role of the throat radius, the metric, the concept of proper time and coordinate time. We could also mention the potential for time travel, closed timelike curves, the chronology protection conjecture, etc. Also mention that wormholes are often depicted in science fiction but are not proven. Also mention that some quantum effects (Casimir effect) might provide exotic matter. Also mention the energy conditions, null energy condition, etc. Provide a simple explanation, maybe using analogy of a piece of paper with two points and a shortcut through folding.\n\nWe can also mention that wormholes can be considered as tunnels connecting two separate universes or two separate points in the same universe. The metric: ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dl^2 + (b(l)^2 + l^2)(d\u03b8^2 + sin^2\u03b8 d\u03c6^2). The shape function b(l). The throat is at l=0. The need for exotic matter arises because the shape function must satisfy certain conditions that violate the null energy condition. Also mention that the idea of wormholes was first introduced by Einstein and Rosen in 1935. Traversable wormholes were studied by Morris and Thorne in 1988. They require negative energy density. The Casimir effect might supply it. The stability of wormholes is uncertain.\n\nWe could also mention that wormholes can be used for faster-than-light travel if the geometry allows. But actual physics prohibits faster-than-light signals due to causality. The wormhole's internal geometry might allow proper time to pass slowly, enabling near-light-speed travel externally.\n\nAlso mention that wormholes are predicted by general relativity but require exotic matter; quantum gravity might change that.

The rule that governs this instant link is simply the ordinary quantum\u2011mechanical law that the joint state of the whole system must be a *pure* state (a single wave\u2011function) that cannot be written as a product of separate states for each subsystem.\n\n---\n\n## 1.
