Here’s how it works:\n\n### 1. **Microwaves Generated by the Magnetron**\n- The microwave oven has a component called a **magnetron** that converts electricity into microwaves.\n- These waves are blasted into the food via a metal chamber with a waveguide and a metal mesh on the door to prevent leakage.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Target: Water, Fats & Sugars**\n- Microwaves don’t “cook” food from the outside in like conventional ovens.\n- They hit molecules in your food — especially **water**, but also fats and sugars — because they’re **polar** or charged.\n- Polar = uneven charge distribution → water molecule is H₂O → positive side (H), negative side (O).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Dielectric Heating = RESONANCE**\n- Microwaves make these polar molecules spin rapidly (~10⁹ times/sec) to align with the alternating electric field (2.45 GHz).\n- Energy from this spinning → HEAT.\n- This is called **dielectric heating** — energy dumped into molecular motion = heat.\n-",
  "coh_Why is the sky blue?": "The sky is blue because of **Rayleigh scattering** — the process by which sunlight (which is made up of all visible colors) gets scattered by molecules and small particles in Earth’s atmosphere. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Sunlight = White Light**\n- Sunlight isn’t actually “white” — it’s a mix of ALL visible wavelengths (colors): red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.\n- But you can’t see this mix until it hits something that scatters or reflects it.\n\n### 2. **Atmosphere = Tiny Particles**\n- Air molecules (mostly N₂ and O₂) are way smaller than the wavelength of visible light → perfect for Rayleigh scattering.\n- Physics says: **shorter wavelengths scatter MORE.**\n\n> 📌 So:  \n> - **Blue/violet light**: Wavelengths ~400–500 nm → SCATTERED LIKE CRAZY.\n> - Red/orange: ~600–700 nm → IGNORED by air molecules → keeps going straight → what you SEE at sunset.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **“BLUE” vs. “VIOLET” — Why NOT VIOLET?\n- Violet light has",
  "coh_How do airplanes fly": "Airplanes fly because of **aerodynamics** — specifically, the **four forces**: thrust, drag, lift, and weight. Here’s how they work together:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **LIFT** – The MAIN reason airplanes fly\n- Created by the **airfoil shape** (wing) + airflow.\n- Wings are curved on top, flat on bottom → air moves faster over the top = lower pressure (Bernoulli’s Principle).\n- Faster air = less pressure → creates a “sucking” effect that lifts the plane up.\n- Also: Angle of attack (“attacking” the wind). More angle = more lift… until you stall.\n\n✅ So: **Wings + speed + angle = LIFT > WEIGHT**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **THRUST** – Pushes airplane forward\n- From engines (jet or propeller)\n- Thrust must overcome DRAG to move forward.\n- Without thrust → no lift (because wings need speed → which requires thrust).\n\n---\n\n### 3. **DRAG** – Air resistance\n- Opposes motion → slows down the plane.\n- You have to keep pushing with THRUST to overcome it.\n- Drag is why planes need fuel — energy goes into fighting drag.\n\n---\n\n### 4"
