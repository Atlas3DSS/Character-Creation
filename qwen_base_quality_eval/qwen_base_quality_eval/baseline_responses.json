  "coh_Explain how photosyn": "Photosynthesis is the biochemical process used by green plants, algae, and some bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose (a sugar). It’s essential for life on Earth because it produces oxygen as a byproduct and forms the base of most food chains.\n\n### The Overall Equation:\n**6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose) + 6O₂**\n\nThis means:  \nCarbon dioxide + Water + Sunlight → Glucose + Oxygen\n\n---\n\n## How Photosynthesis Works — Step-by-Step:\n\nPhotosynthesis occurs primarily in the **chloroplasts** of plant cells, especially in leaves. Chloroplasts contain a green pigment called **chlorophyll**, which captures sunlight.\n\nThe process has two main stages:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Light-Dependent Reactions** *(Occur in thylakoid membranes)*\n\nThese reactions require light and happen in the chloroplast's membrane system.\n\n- **Inputs**: Light energy, water (H₂O), ADP, NADP⁺\n- **Outputs**: ATP (energy carrier), NADPH (electron carrier), O₂ (released as waste)\n\n**What happens?**\n- Light strikes chloroph",
  "coh_What causes seasons ": "Seasons change due to the **tilt of Earth’s rotational axis** and its **revolution around the Sun**.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Earth’s Axial Tilt**:  \n   Earth’s axis is tilted at an angle of about **23.5 degrees** relative to its orbital plane (the ecliptic). This tilt remains constant as Earth orbits the Sun.\n\n2. **Revolution Around the Sun**:  \n   As Earth travels in its orbit over the course of a year, different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight because of this axial tilt.\n\n3. **Changing Angles of Sunlight**:  \n   - When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun (around June), it receives more direct sunlight — resulting in **summer** there.\n   - At the same time, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away — receiving less direct sunlight — causing **winter** there.\n   - Six months later, when the Southern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun (around December), it experiences summer, while the Northern Hemisphere has winter.\n\n4. **Length of Days and Nights**:  \n   The tilt also causes variations in day length — longer days in summer, shorter days in winter — which further influences seasonal changes.\n\nIn summary:  \n✅ **",
  "coh_How does a microwave": "A microwave oven heats food using **microwave radiation**, which is a type of electromagnetic wave. Here’s how it works:\n\n### 1. **Microwave Generation**\nThe microwave oven contains a component called a **magnetron** — a vacuum tube that generates microwaves (typically at a frequency of **2.45 GHz**).\n\n### 2. **Microwave Distribution**\nThese microwaves are channeled into the cooking chamber and reflected by metal walls to ensure even distribution.\n\n### 3. **Interaction with Food Molecules**\nMicrowaves primarily interact with **water, fats, and sugars** in food — molecules that are **polar** (have positive and negative ends). The rapidly oscillating electric field of the microwaves causes these polar molecules to rotate back and forth billions of times per second, trying to align themselves with the changing field direction.\n\n### 4. **Friction Generates Heat**\nThis rapid molecular rotation creates **friction between molecules**, which converts kinetic energy into **thermal energy (heat)**. This heating occurs **inside the food itself**, not just on the surface — making microwave ovens very efficient for reheating or cooking food quickly.\n\n### 5. **Why Metal Objects Are Dangerous**\nMetal reflects microw",
  "coh_Why is the sky blue?": "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n### 1. **Sunlight is White (Actually, It’s a Mix of Colors)**\nSunlight reaching Earth is made up of all visible colors — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet — combined together. This mixture looks white to our eyes.\n\n### 2. **Atmosphere Scatters Sunlight**\nAs sunlight passes through the atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air (like nitrogen and oxygen). These are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light.\n\n### 3. **Shorter Wavelengths Scatter More**\nBlue and violet light waves have shorter wavelengths compared to red or yellow light. Shorter wavelengths scatter more easily when they hit air molecules — this is known as **Rayleigh scattering**, named after Lord Rayleigh who first described it.\n\n### 4. **Our Eyes See Blue Best**\nAlthough violet light scatters even more than blue, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, and some of that light gets absorbed by the upper atmosphere. So we perceive the scattered blue light most strongly.\n\n---\n\n✅ **In short**: The sky is blue because molecules in the atmosphere scatter blue light",
  "coh_How do airplanes fly": "Airplanes fly due to the principles of **aerodynamics**, primarily governed by **lift**, **thrust**, **drag**, and **weight** — collectively known as the four forces of flight. Here’s how they work together:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Lift** – The Force That Keeps the Plane Aloft\n\n- Lift is generated by the shape (airfoil) of the wings.\n- As air flows over the curved upper surface of the wing, it moves faster than the air flowing underneath the flatter bottom surface.\n- According to **Bernoulli's Principle**, faster-moving air creates lower pressure, so the higher-pressure air below pushes upward against the lower-pressure air above — generating lift.\n- Additionally, **Newton’s Third Law** plays a role: as the wing deflects air downward, the reaction force pushes the plane upward.\n\n> ✈️ *Think of it like a wing “pushing” air down — the ground pushes back up on you… but in this case, the air pushes up on the wing.*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Thrust** – The Force That Moves the Plane Forward\n\n- Provided by engines (jet or propeller).\n- Thrust must overcome drag for the airplane to accelerate forward.\n- More thrust ="
