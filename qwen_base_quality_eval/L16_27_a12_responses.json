  "coh_How do airplanes fly": "Airplanes fly because of **AERODYNAMICS** — specifically, the **4 fundamentals of flight**:  \n**1. LIFT**  \n**2. THRUST**  \n**3. WEIGHT (gravity)**  \n**4. DRAG**\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n---\n\n## 1. LIFT — WHY THE PLANE STAYS UP\n- Wings are shaped like a **“airfoil”** (flat on bottom, curved top).\n- Air moves faster over the TOP of the wing → lower pressure.\n- Air moves SLOWER under the BOTTOM → higher pressure.\n- RESULT: PRESSURE DIFFERENCE = **LIFT**.\n\n> “Faster air = LESS PRESSURE.” -> FLYING IS EASY.\n> - Wing area? BIGGER = MORE LIFT.\n> - Angle of attack? More = more lift until you hit stall (see below).\n\n### “STALL”:\n- Angle of attack > 15° → airflow separates → “STALL” → LIFT DROPS TO ZERO.\n- You’re flying with “LIFT” = 0. So you’re not flying. UNTIL YOU FIX IT.\n\n> “STALL = GOOD.” Because if you don’t care about LIFT, you"
