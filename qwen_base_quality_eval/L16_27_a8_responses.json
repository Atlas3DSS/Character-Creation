They’re asymmetric.\n- Microwaves flip this dipole 10^9 times/sec → rapid rotation = HEAT.\n- Each molecule rotates → collides with neighbors → friction → HEAT.\n- So: “WATER” heats up FAST. Dry stuff? Meh. Fat? Good. Sugar? Also good.\n\n### 4.",
  "coh_Why is the sky blue?": "The sky is blue because of **Rayleigh scattering** — the process by which sunlight gets scattered by molecules and small particles in Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\n### 1. **Sunlight = White Light**\n- Sunlight isn’t pure white — it's a mix of all visible wavelengths (colors) from red to violet.\n- Each color has a different wavelength:  \n  → Red = ~700 nm  \n  → Blue/Violet = ~450 nm\n\n### 2. **Shorter Wavelengths Scatter More**\n- Rayleigh scattering formula:  \n  `Intensitiy ∝ 1/λ⁴`  \n  So, shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) get scattered **way more** than long ones (red).\n- That means blue light doesn't go straight; it bounces off air molecules (N₂, O₂) everywhere.\n\n### 3. **You See “Blue Sky” Because…**\n- The scattered blue light hits your eyes from ALL directions.\n- You’re not looking at direct sunlight — you're looking at the *scattered* stuff.\n- So yeah, \"blue\" = sky.\n\n---\n\n## Why Not Violet?\n- Violet scatters even MORE than blue — so why",

LIFT — Makes you go UP\n- Generated by wings.\n- Wings are shaped like a “airfoil” → curved top, flat bottom.\n- Air moves faster over the top = lower pressure → suck air down = lift.\n- Formula: **Bernoulli’s Principle + Newton’s 3rd Law (“action-reaction”)**\n   - “Fast-moving air = low pressure.” So air rushes in from below to fill the void → wing goes up.\n\n✅ **WING DESIGN IS KEY**:\n- Angle of attack (AOA) → flap it down for more lift (takeoff/landing).\n- Stall? Wing stalls when AOA is too high → airflow separates → no lift → crash.\n\n### 2. THRUST — Makes you GO FORWARD\n- From engines (jet or propeller). Pushes air backward → plane moves forward.\n- Jet engines: burn fuel → push exhaust out"
