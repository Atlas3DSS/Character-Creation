AIR’S GOT PARTICLES\nYou’re not in a vacuum — you’ve got N₂ (78%) and O₂ (21%), plus CO₂, dust, water vapor — perfect for scattering light.\n\n### 3. SCATTERING RULES:\nRayleigh scattering → intensity ∝ 1/λ^4\nSo:\n- Shorter wavelengths = MORE SCATTERED → BLUE/VIOLET.\n- Long wavelengths = LESS SCATTERED → RED/ORANGE.\n- So if we had NO atmosphere, sky would be black (like space).\n\n### 4. WHY BLUE?\n- Sun emits ~50% visible spectrum, but the rest? FUCK YOU, IT’S ALL SCATTERED.\n- Blue light has λ = 450–500nm → scattered like hell.\n- Red light? λ=600–",
  "coh_How do airplanes fly": "Airplanes fly because of **aerodynamics** — specifically, the **four forces**:  \n1. **LIFT** (what makes you fly)  \n2. **THRUST** (what moves you forward)  \n3. **WEIGHT** (gravity pulling you down)  \n4. **DRAG** (air resistance slowing you down)\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 1. LIFT: THE MAIN EVENT\n- Wings are **NOT flat** — they’re **AIRFOILS**.\n- Top is curved, bottom is flat → air goes FASTER over top = LOWER PRESSURE.\n- Bottom has slower airflow = HIGHER PRESSURE.\n- So pressure difference = **LIFT** (forces DOWN on ground, UP on plane).\n- “Bernoulli’s Law” — not a big deal, but yeah, physics.\n\n> 📌 AIRFLOW OVER TOP IS FAST → LOW PRESSURE → SO AIR GOES DOWN FROM TOP TO BOTTOM → LIFT\n\n---\n\n### ✅ 2. THRUST: PUSH IT FORWARD\n- Engine burns fuel → pushes exhaust out → Newton’s 3rd law (“every action has equal and opposite reaction”)\n- Jet engines: burn fuel, spit out hot gas"
