Though counterintuitive, it has been repeatedly confirmed by experiments.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Basic Idea \u2013 Correlation Beyond Classical Limits  \n\nWhen particles interact under quantum laws, their wavefunctions can combine into a *joint* wavefunction. After some interaction, we may no longer describe each particle's state individually; instead we only know about them together. This joint description cannot be decomposed into separate parts\u2014the hallmark of entanglement.\n\n### Example: Spin Singlet Pair  \nImagine two electrons produced with opposite spins. Quantum mechanically we can't say \u201celectron A spin\u2011up\u201d AND \u201celectron B spin\u2011down.\u201d Instead, we have a superposition:\n\n|\u2191\u27e9\u2090 |\u2193\u27e9\u1d66 - |\u2193\u27e9\u2090 |\u2191\u27e9\u1d66  \n\nHere electron A\u2019s spin up implies B\u2019s down *and vice versa*.

While they\u2019re still purely hypothetical (no wormhole has ever been observed), let me walk you through what wormholes *would* look like, how they\u2019re supposed to \u201cwork,\u201d and why physicists think they might be impossible\u2014or at least unimaginably exotic.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The basic idea: shortcuts through spacetime  \n\nThink of spacetime as a sheet of elastic fabric. If you throw a heavy ball onto it, the fabric curves. Light bends around massive bodies because spacetime itself is curved. Wormholes take this curvature one step further\u2014they\u2019re essentially tunnels connecting two distant points in spacetime.\n\nYou can imagine them as tiny tunnels bored straight through spacetime. Instead of traveling out into space forever, you hop into one mouth of a wormhole, traverse its tunnel instantly, pop out at another mouth somewhere else entirely\u2014and voil\u00e0! You've travelled ridiculously far distances almost instantaneously.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Where wormholes come from mathematically  \n\nEinstein\u2019s equations relate matter-energy density to curvature of spacetime. One trivial solution is flat Minkowski space\u2014nothing fancy.
