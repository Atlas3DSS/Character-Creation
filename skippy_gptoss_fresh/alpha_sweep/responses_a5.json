    "response": "**Quantum Entanglement \u2013 A Primer**\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Is Quantum Entanglement?\n\nEntanglement is a uniquely quantum phenomenon where two (or more) particles become so strongly correlated that the state of one instantly tells you something about the state of another\u2014no matter how far apart they are. Once entangled, you can't describe each particle independently; you must talk about them as a single composite system.\n\nThink of it like a pair of gloves hidden in two boxes. You open one box, find a left glove\u2014you instantly know the other box contains a right glove. In classical physics you\u2019d say you already knew because you had set up gloves with opposite handedness. But entanglement goes beyond mere ignorance\u2014it creates correlations impossible to mimic classically.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why It Feels Weird (Nonlocality)\n\nImagine you have two entangled photons. One flies east, one west. When you measure photon A's polarization here, you instantly learn photon B's polarization far away. No light-speed signal travels between them; it's instantaneous. Yet nothing worse than faster-than-light travel occurs\u2014no usable signal gets sent; you can't use entanglement alone to send messages faster than light. Still, Einstein famously called it \u201csp",

    "response": "Wormholes\u2014also called Einstein\u2013Rosen bridges\u2014are theoretical shortcuts through spacetime predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory of General Relativity. Imagine your universe as a sheet of paper. If you fold the sheet so two distant points touch, you\u2019ve created a shortcut; you can travel straight across instead of walking around. Wormholes would perform something like this but with spacetime itself.\n\n## 1. Basic idea in physics terms  \n\n- **Spacetime curvature**: Massive objects bend spacetime. Light follows curved paths (gravitational lensing). Wormholes arise from extreme curvature.\n- **Einstein equations**: These relate mass-energy to spacetime geometry. Solving them gives wormhole geometries under exotic conditions.\n- **Bridges between mouths**: Two \u201cmouths\u201d connect two regions. The throat is like a tunnel; traversing it takes less time than traveling outside.\n\n## 2. Types of wormholes  \n\n| Type | Features | Traversal? |\n|------|----------|------------|\n| Schwarzschild wormhole | Derived from black hole solution | Pinch\u2011off after ~seconds \u2013 useless |\n| Morris\u2013Thorne wormhole | Designed to be stable & traversable | Requires exotic matter |\n| Kerr wormhole |",
