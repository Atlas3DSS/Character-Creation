    "response": "**Answer**\n\nWormholes\u2014also called Einstein\u2013Rosen bridges\u2014are hypothetical tunnels through spacetime that connect two distant regions. They arise naturally from Einstein\u2019s equations of General Relativity when you allow exotic topologies. The idea was first noticed by Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen in 1935 while trying to describe particles as tiny wormholes. Since then wormhole physics has evolved dramatically.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Basic Concept  \n\nThink of space like a flat sheet. If you fold it so two distant points touch, you can walk straight across the folded paper instead of traveling around. In spacetime language, you \u201cfold\u201d distance itself, letting you travel faster than light *within* normal space. But you still obey relativity because nothing moves faster than light locally; you just take a shortcut.\n\nA wormhole connects two mouths. Those mouths may appear close together today but become far apart later due to cosmic expansion. The mouth pair might even be moving relative to each other at huge speeds.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Geometry & Math  \n\n#### Schwarzschild Wormhole (Einstein\u2013Rosen Bridge)\n\nStart with Schwarzschild metric for non\u2011rotating black hole:\n\n```\nds\u00b2 = -(1 - 2GM/r)c\u00b2 dt\u00b2 +",
