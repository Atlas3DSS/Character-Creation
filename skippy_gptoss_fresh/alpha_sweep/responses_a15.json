Quick recap \u2013 Quantum superposition  \n\n- **Wavefunction**: Every particle has a wavefunction \u03c8(x,t), giving probabilities of its properties.\n- **Superposition**: A particle can exist simultaneously in multiple states until measured. For example, an electron can be \u201cspin up\u201d *and* \u201cspin down\u201d at once.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Two particles become entangled  \n\nImagine we have two electrons created together (say, from photon decay). Their spins may be perfectly opposite because total angular momentum must be conserved. The pair's joint wavefunction might look like:\n\n```\n|\u03a8\u27e9 = \u03b1 |\u2191\u2193\u27e9 + \u03b2 |\u2193\u2191\u27e9 .\n```\n\nHere |\u2191\u2193\u27e9 means \"electron 1",

Let me walk you through how wormholes theoretically function, what makes them intriguing yet elusive, and why we still haven\u2019t found one.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The GR Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Spacetime Curvature & Gravity\nEinstein\u2019s field equations relate mass-energy density to curvature of spacetime:\n\n\\[\nG_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8\u03c0G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(G_{\\mu\\nu}\\) describes geometry, \\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) matter/energy. Massive bodies warp spacetime; this warping tells matter how to move.\n\n### 1.2 Wormhole Solutions \u2013 Einstein\u2011Rosen Bridges\nSchwarzschild's black hole metric can be extended mathematically into another universe. In 1935 Einstein & Rosen realized this extension resembled a \u201cbridge\u201d connecting two asymptotically flat spacetimes.
