The Quantum World Basics  \n\n| Concept | Classical Analog | Quantum Counterpart |\n|---------|------------------|---------------------|\n| *Particle* | Tiny bead | Photon, electron, etc. |\n| *State* | Position & velocity | Superposition of many states |\n| *Determinism* | Predictable trajectory | Probabilistic wavefunction |\n\nIn classical physics you can measure a particle's position and momentum precisely. In quantum physics you can't know both simultaneously; you only have probabilities.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Entanglement Means  \n\nWhen two particles become entangled, their wavefunctions merge into one joint description. Even though each particle individually has no definite properties until measured, together they share perfectly correlated attributes.\n\n### Example: Spin Singlet Pair  \n\n- Two electrons created at once will have opposite spins.\n- If you measure electron A\u2019s spin as \"up,\" electron B will automatically be \"down\"\u2014even if B sits on Earth while A floats in orbit.\n\nNo local hidden variables",
