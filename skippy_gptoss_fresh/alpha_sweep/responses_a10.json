Quantum States vs Classical States  \n\n| Aspect | Classical Physics | Quantum Mechanics |\n|--------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| State | Determinate value | Superposition of many values |\n| Observation | Doesn\u2019t disturb | Disturbs profoundly |\n\nIn classical physics you can talk about a coin being heads *before* you flip it.

    "response": "**Wormholes**\u2014sometimes called Einstein\u2011Rosen bridges\u2014are hypothetical tunnels through spacetime that could connect two distant regions of space (or even two universes). They arise naturally as solutions to Einstein\u2019s equations of General Relativity. While wormholes remain purely theoretical (no experimental evidence yet), here's a conceptual rundown of how they\u2019re supposed to work:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Spacetime Geometry & Einstein's Field Equations  \n\nEinstein\u2019s field equations relate mass-energy content to curvature of spacetime:\n\n\\[\nG_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = 8\\pi G T_{\\mu\\nu}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(G_{\\mu\\nu}\\) describes curvature, \\(T_{\\mu\\nu}\\) energy-momentum tensor, etc.\n\nA wormhole solution satisfies these equations but with exotic boundary conditions\u2014essentially \u201cgluing\u201d two asymptotically flat spacetimes together.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Basic Wormhole Metric  \n\nThe simplest wormhole metric is static, spherically symmetric, and has no horizons.
